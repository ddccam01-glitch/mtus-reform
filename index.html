            <p><strong>AI-ASSISTED RESEARCH:</strong> Much of the research, analysis, and text presented here was compiled with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. AI-generated content may contain errors, omissions, or inaccuracies. The author makes no representations about the accuracy or completeness of AI-generated content.</p>
            
            <p><strong>PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:</strong> This site documents the author's personal experiences with the California workers' compensation system. Individual experiences may vary. Nothing herein should be interpreted as representing the experiences of others.</p>
            
            <p><strong>ACOEM AND OTHER NAMES:</strong> References to the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM), California Division of Workers' Compensation (DWC), Medical Treatment Utilization Schedule (MTUS), or other organizations are used for descriptive and informational purposes only, constituting fair use for purposes of criticism, commentary, and educational analysis. Use of these names does not imply endorsement, affiliation, or authorization.</p>
            
            <p><strong>NO STATEMENTS OF FACT ABOUT ACOEM:</strong> All statements regarding ACOEM, its guidelines, methodologies, or organizational practices are expressions of opinion, interpretation, and analytical commentary—not statements of objective fact. The author does not claim to have insider knowledge of ACOEM's internal processes, motivations, or decision-making. All criticisms relate to publicly available documents and their observable effects, not to the character, competence, or integrity of ACOEM as an organization or its individual members. No statements are made about any ACOEM member, employee, or official as an individual.</p>
            
            <p><strong>ANTI-DEFAMATION/ANTI-LIBEL NOTICE:</strong> Nothing on this site constitutes defamation, libel, or disparagement of ACOEM or any other person or organization. Specifically:
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; color: #856404;">
                <li>No false statements of fact are made about ACOEM</li>
                <li>All criticisms relate to publicly available guidelines and their public-policy effects</li>
                <li>Opinions about "systemic issues" or "constitutional questions" are legal theories, not factual accusations</li>
                <li>The author has made good-faith efforts to base all statements on publicly available documents</li>
                <li>The author welcomes correction of any inadvertent errors</li>
                <li>All statements are protected opinion under the First Amendment and California anti-SLAPP laws</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>CONTEXTUAL READING REQUIRED:</strong> Statements that may appear factual (e.g., "MTUS denies treatments") must be read in context as shorthand for "based on my analysis of the publicly available guidelines, it appears that MTUS results in treatment denials." This is opinion based on documentary evidence, not a factual assertion about internal ACOEM operations.</p>
            
            <p><strong>NO DEFAMATORY INTENT:</strong> Nothing on this site is intended to defame, disparage, or harm the reputation of any individual, organization, or entity. The author expresses opinions about systems, policies, and guidelines—not about the character or competence of individuals.</p>
            
            <p><strong>ALLEGATIONS VS. FINDINGS:</strong> Terms such as "constitutional violation," "discrimination," or "unconstitutional" represent the author's analytical opinions and legal theories—not proven facts or court findings. No court has ruled on the claims presented herein.</p>

            <p><strong>SUBSTANTIAL TRUTH DEFENSE:</strong> To the extent any statement on this site touches upon matters of provable fact, the author believes such statements to be substantially true based on good-faith review of publicly available documents. Any inadvertent errors are exactly that—inadvertent—and will be promptly corrected upon notice. Good-faith errors of fact do not constitute defamation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>CALIFORNIA ANTI-SLAPP PROTECTION:</strong> This site involves public issues including workers' compensation policy, access to medical care, and constitutional questions. All statements are protected under California Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16 (anti-SLAPP statute). Any lawsuit filed in response to this site's content will be met with an immediate anti-SLAPP motion. Prevailing defendants will recover attorney's fees and costs.</p>
            
            <p><strong>DOCUMENT SOURCES & FAIR USE:</strong> Documents and excerpts from the ACOEM guidelines, MTUS regulations, and other materials are reproduced under the doctrine of fair use (17 U.S.C. § 107) for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

        <h2>🎯 Purpose of This Research</h2>
        
        <p>This research project examines the Medical Treatment Utilization Schedule (MTUS) system in California workers' compensation from a constitutional perspective. The author believes that certain aspects of this system may raise important questions about equal protection and access to medical care.</p>
        
        <p>The goal is to:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <li>Document the author's personal experiences with the system</li>
            <li>Analyze publicly available guidelines from a legal perspective</li>
            <li>Raise awareness about potential systemic issues</li>
            <li>Contribute to public discourse on workers' compensation reform</li>
            <li>Connect with documentary filmmakers, legal advocates, and policymakers interested in these issues</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>This is advocacy and opinion, not established fact.</strong> The author welcomes dialogue, corrections, and alternative perspectives.</p>
