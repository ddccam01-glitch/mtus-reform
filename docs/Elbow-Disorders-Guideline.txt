EVIDENCE QUALITY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

**ACOEM'S STATED METHODOLOGY:**
- Requires randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for "Strongly Recommended" status
- Systematic reviews prioritized over individual studies
- Cost-effectiveness analyses incorporated

**CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS:**
1. 90.1% "Insufficient Evidence" is the HIGHEST rate among all 17 MTUS guidelines
2. Only 1.5% of treatments are "Strongly Recommended"
3. Evidence threshold effectively denies coverage for most conservative treatments

================================================================================
CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

This guideline demonstrates the most egregious denial pattern in the MTUS system.
With only 1.5% "Strongly Recommended" and 90.1% "Insufficient Evidence," injured 
workers have virtually no guaranteed access to treatment.
