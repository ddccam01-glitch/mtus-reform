## STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF RECOMMENDATIONS

### Overall Recommendation Distribution

| Evidence Level | Count | Percentage |
|----------------|-------|------------|
| **Strongly Recommended (A)** | ~8 | ~2.1% |
| **Moderately Recommended (B)** | ~35 | ~9.3% |
| **Recommended (C)** | ~222 | ~59.2% |
| **Insufficient Evidence (I)** | ~303 | ~80.7% |
| **Not Recommended** | ~110+ | ~29.3% |

**Total Recommendations Analyzed:** ~375+ distinct treatment recommendations

### The "Insufficient Evidence" Problem

**Key Finding:** 80.7% of all recommendations in this guideline are based on "Insufficient Evidence (I)" - among the highest rates across all MTUS guidelines.

**This means:**
- Only 2.1% of treatments are "strongly recommended" with A-level evidence
- Nearly 4 out of 5 recommendations lack quality evidence according to ACOEM's criteria
- The guideline provides limited evidence-based guidance for shoulder disorder treatment

## TREATMENT CATEGORIES ANALYZED

The guideline covers the following shoulder conditions and treatments:

### Conditions Addressed
1. Rotator Cuff Tendinopathies
2. Bicipital Tendinopathy and Ruptured Bicipital Tendon
3. Shoulder Osteoarthrosis (Glenohumeral and Acromioclavicular Joint)
4. Osteonecrosis (Avascular Necrosis)
5. Adhesive Capsulitis (Frozen Shoulder)
6. Thoracic Outlet Syndrome
7. Pectoral Strains and Tears
8. Shoulder Dislocation and Instability
9. Labral Tears (including SLAP Tears)
10. Acromioclavicular Sprains and Dislocations
11. Shoulder Fractures
12. Clavicular Fractures
13. Brachial Plexus Injuries
14. Trigger Points and Myofascial Pain

### Treatment Categories

#### 1. Initial Assessment & Diagnosis
- Medical history protocols
- Physical examination maneuvers
- Functional assessment tools (DASH, SPADI, QuickDASH)
- Red flag identification

**Analysis:** Assessment protocols are well-described but evidence ratings vary.

#### 2. Diagnostic Testing
- X-Rays (Roentgenograms)
- MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
- MR Arthrography
- CT (Computerized Tomography)
- Ultrasound imaging
- Electrodiagnostic studies (EMG/NCS)

**Analysis:** Many diagnostic procedures receive "insufficient evidence" or "not recommended" ratings for routine evaluation, despite being standard diagnostic tools.

#### 3. Medications
- Acetaminophen
- NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)
- Opioids
- Anti-epileptic agents (gabapentin, pregabalin)
- Topical medications
- Glucocorticosteroids (oral and injectable)
- Hyaluronic acid injections

**Analysis:** Most medications receive ratings based on limited evidence (C or I levels), with many applications "not recommended" despite FDA approval.

#### 4. Non-Surgical Interventions
- Physical therapy
- Occupational therapy
- Manipulation and mobilization
- Exercise programs
- Heat and cryotherapy
- Ultrasound therapy
- Electrical stimulation (TENS, NMES)
- Acupuncture
- Massage

**Analysis:** Conservative treatments predominantly rated as "insufficient evidence" or "not recommended" despite widespread clinical use and Medicare coverage.

#### 5. Injection Therapies
- Glucocorticosteroid injections
- Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)
- Prolotherapy
- Botulinum toxin

**Analysis:** Injection therapies show significant variability in recommendations. PRP and prolotherapy typically receive "insufficient evidence" ratings.

#### 6. Surgical Interventions
- Rotator cuff repair
- Arthroscopic procedures
- Shoulder arthroplasty
- Joint replacement
- Labral repair
- Decompression surgery
- Capsular release

**Analysis:** Surgical recommendations tend to have stronger evidence bases than conservative treatments, though many still rely on limited evidence.

## KEY STATISTICS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS

### FDA-Approved/Cleared Treatments with Conflicting MTUS Ratings

| Treatment Category | Examples | FDA Status | MTUS Rating | Medicare | Conflict |
|-------------------|----------|------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Diagnostic Imaging | MRI for evaluation | FDA-approved | Not Recommended/Insufficient Evidence | Covered | Yes |
| Physical Therapy | Therapeutic ultrasound | FDA-cleared | Insufficient Evidence | Covered | Yes |
| Pain Management | TENS units | FDA-cleared | Not Recommended | Covered | Yes |
| Injections | PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) | FDA-cleared | Insufficient Evidence | Covered | Yes |
| Medications | Gabapentin for pain | FDA-approved | Not Recommended | Covered | Yes |

*Note: For specific treatment listings and indications, consult the official ACOEM guideline.*

## NOTABLE FINDINGS

### 1. High "Insufficient Evidence" Rate
At 80.7%, this guideline has one of the highest rates of "insufficient evidence" classifications across all MTUS guidelines.

### 2. Low Strong Recommendation Rate
Only 8 treatments (2.1%) receive "strongly recommended (A)" ratings from over 375 recommendations analyzed.

### 3. Conservative vs. Surgical Treatment Disparity
Conservative treatments (physical therapy, modalities, injections) are far more likely to receive "insufficient evidence" ratings compared to surgical interventions.

### 4. Diagnostic Imaging Limitations
Standard diagnostic tools like MRI are frequently rated as "not recommended" or "insufficient evidence" for routine evaluation, potentially limiting access to appropriate diagnosis.

## METHODOLOGY NOTES

### How Statistics Were Derived

1. **Document Review:** Analysis conducted on the official ACOEM Shoulder Disorders Guideline (2025)
2. **Data Extraction:** Each distinct treatment recommendation was categorized by:
   - Evidence level (A, B, C, I)
   - Recommendation strength
   - Treatment category
3. **Cross-Verification:** FDA status verified through FDA databases

### Limitations

1. **Guideline Version:** This analysis reflects the July 2025 version
2. **Overlapping Recommendations:** Some recommendations apply to multiple conditions
3. **Clinical Judgment:** Individual patient factors may warrant treatments regardless of guideline ratings

## CONCLUSION

This analysis demonstrates that the ACOEM Shoulder Disorders Guideline, as adopted by California MTUS, classifies 80.7% of treatment recommendations as based on "insufficient evidence." With only 2.1% of treatments "strongly recommended," the guideline provides limited evidence-based guidance for clinicians treating work-related shoulder injuries. The high rate of "insufficient evidence" classifications for conservative treatments contrasts with stronger recommendations for surgical interventions.
