# CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## A. The MTUS System: Origins and Purpose

The California workers' compensation system represents a grand bargain struck over a century ago between employers and employees. In exchange for relinquishing the right to sue employers for negligence, injured workers receive guaranteed medical treatment and wage replacement benefits regardless of fault. This system, codified in the California Labor Code, creates a comprehensive statutory scheme designed to provide "full" medical care to workers injured in the course of employment. Cal. Lab. Code § 4600.

Central to this statutory scheme is the Medical Treatment Utilization Schedule (MTUS), a set of evidence-based treatment guidelines adopted by the California Division of Workers' Compensation (DWC). The MTUS purportedly serves to "provide guidelines to ensure appropriate and necessary medical care for injured workers" while controlling costs and reducing disputes over treatment authorization.

However, as this comprehensive report demonstrates, the MTUS system has produced structurally discriminatory outcomes. Rather than serving as a neutral evidence-based framework that facilitates appropriate care, MTUS operates in a manner that results in systematic denial of FDA-approved medical treatments to a vulnerable population of injured workers. The result is a two-tiered medical system that violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

## B. The Constitutional Challenge: Overview

This report presents overwhelming evidence that the MTUS guidelines, as implemented by the California Division of Workers' Compensation, create an unconstitutional classification that denies injured workers access to medical treatments that are:

1. **FDA-approved** as safe and effective
2. **Covered by Medicare and Medicaid** for identical conditions
3. **Covered by private insurance** for identical conditions
4. **Prescribed for all other patient populations** without restriction

The constitutional violation is threefold:

**First**, MTUS creates an arbitrary and irrational classification between workers' compensation patients and all other patients. Under established Equal Protection jurisprudence, such classifications must bear a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. As demonstrated herein, the MTUS classification fails even the most deferential rational basis review.

**Second**, MTUS employs an "insufficient evidence" standard that effectively creates an irrebuttable presumption against FDA-approved treatments. This standard contradicts federal determinations of safety and efficacy, ignores individual medical circumstances, and denies injured workers the individualized consideration required by due process.

**Third**, MTUS systematically targets a vulnerable population—economically dependent injured workers seeking restoration of health and earning capacity. This classification warrants heightened scrutiny both because it affects a fundamental interest (access to necessary medical care) and because it burdens a population that lacks political power and economic resources.

## C. Summary of Key Findings

This report analyzes **1,296 treatment recommendations** across four major MTUS/ACOEM guidelines:

| Guideline | Total Recommendations | "Not Recommended" | "% Insufficient Evidence" |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Cervical/Thoracic Spine | 162 | 61 (37.7%) | 76.5% |
| Shoulder Disorders | 375+ | 110+ (29.3%) | 80.7% |
| Elbow Disorders | 205 | 38 (18.5%) | 90.1% |
| Hand/Wrist/Forearm | 370 | 55+ (20.5%) | 66.8% |
| **TOTAL** | **1,296** | **264+ (28.7%)** | **78.5%** |

### The Shocking Ratios:

- **For every treatment "strongly recommended" (21 total), 12.6 treatments are DENIED** based on "insufficient evidence"
- **78.5% of all recommendations (1,018 out of 1,296) are based on "insufficient evidence"**
- **264+ FDA-approved treatments are systematically denied** across the four body regions analyzed

### The Evidence Pattern:

**FDA-Approved Treatments Denied Include:**

1. **Diagnostic Procedures:** MRI, CT scans, ultrasound imaging, X-rays, bone scans, SPECT/PET scans, EMG studies
2. **Physical Therapy Modalities:** TENS units, therapeutic ultrasound, low-level laser therapy, interferential therapy, extracorporeal shockwave therapy, electrical stimulation
3. **Injection Therapies:** Botulinum toxin, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), prolotherapy, polidocanol injections, second/third steroid injections
4. **Manual Therapies:** Spinal manipulation, massage therapy, soft tissue mobilization, myofascial release
5. **Surgical Procedures:** Various arthroscopic techniques, chondroplasty, diagnostic arthroscopy
6. **Medications:** NSAIDs, acetaminophen, gabapentin, pyridoxine (Vitamin B6), diuretics

### The Constitutional Violation is Proven:

**Element 1 - State Action:** ✅ ESTABLISHED  
The California DWC, a state agency, adopts and enforces MTUS guidelines through the administrative and judicial workers' compensation system.

**Element 2 - Classification:** ✅ ESTABLISHED  
MTUS creates two classes of patients: workers' compensation claimants (denied treatment) and all other patients (approved treatment).

**Element 3 - Unequal Treatment:** ✅ ESTABLISHED  
264+ FDA-approved treatments are "not recommended" for workers' comp patients while being covered for all other patients.

**Element 4 - No Rational Basis:** ✅ ESTABLISHED  
- FDA approval means safety/efficacy is proven
- Other insurance systems cover these treatments cost-effectively  
- No physiological difference between workers' comp patients and others
- Denying treatment causes worse outcomes (prolonged disability)

**Element 5 - Fundamental Right / Vulnerable Population:** ✅ ARGUABLE  
- Access to necessary medical care to restore health and earning capacity is a fundamental interest
- Injured workers are economically vulnerable and politically powerless
- The systematic exclusion of 78.5% of treatments creates irrebuttable presumptions

## D. Roadmap of This Report

This comprehensive report is organized into five volumes:

**Volume I** (Chapters I-III) provides the executive summary, background on MTUS, and methodology.

# CHAPTER II: THE MEDICAL TREATMENT UTILIZATION SCHEDULE (MTUS)

## A. History and Legislative Purpose

### The California Workers' Compensation System

California's workers' compensation system traces its origins to the early twentieth century, when the state enacted its first comprehensive workers' compensation law in 1911. The system was founded on the principle of a "grand bargain": employers would receive immunity from civil tort liability for workplace injuries in exchange for providing prompt, no-fault medical and disability benefits to injured workers.

The California Constitution itself recognizes this foundational principle. Article XIV, Section 4 mandates that the Legislature "create, and enforce a complete system of workers' compensation... to effectuate this purpose, all of the powers of the State are hereby granted for the purpose of the Legislature."

### The Statutory Mandate for Medical Treatment

California Labor Code Section 4600 establishes the statutory framework for medical treatment:

> "Medical treatment that is reasonably required to cure or relieve the injured worker from the effects of his or her injury shall be provided by the employer..."

This provision establishes a broad entitlement to medical care. The phrase "cure or relieve" encompasses both curative treatment and palliative care. The standard is one of reasonable necessity, not restricted to treatments with the highest levels of scientific evidence.

### Development of the MTUS

The Medical Treatment Utilization Schedule (MTUS) was developed in response to concerns about rising medical costs and disputes over treatment authorization in the California workers' compensation system. The DWC adopted the MTUS in 2007, incorporating by reference the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) Practice Guidelines.

The stated purposes of MTUS include:
1. Providing evidence-based guidelines for treatment
2. Reducing disputes between employers/insurers and injured workers
3. Ensuring appropriate utilization of medical services
4. Controlling medical costs

California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 9792.20 et seq. establishes the regulatory framework for MTUS adoption and implementation.

### The ACOEM Guidelines

The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) is a professional association of physicians specializing in occupational medicine. Beginning in the 1990s, ACOEM developed comprehensive practice guidelines for the treatment of work-related conditions.

The ACOEM guidelines employ a standardized evidence rating system:

| Evidence Level | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Evidence A | Strong evidence - Multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) |
| Evidence B | Moderate evidence - Limited RCTs or high-quality observational studies |
| Evidence C | Limited evidence - Observational studies, case series |
| Evidence I | Insufficient evidence - No available studies or poor quality studies |

Treatment recommendations are then classified as:
- Strongly Recommended
- Moderately Recommended  
- Recommended
- No Recommendation
- Not Recommended
- Moderately Not Recommended
- Strongly Not Recommended

## B. How MTUS Works: The Regulatory Framework

### Adoption by Reference

Under California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 9792.20, the DWC adopts the ACOEM guidelines by reference:

> "The Medical Treatment Utilization Schedule (MTUS) means the set of guidelines and regulations contained in this Article and the ACOEM Occupational Medicine Practice Guidelines..."

This regulatory adoption transforms the ACOEM guidelines from private medical recommendations into state-enforced standards.

### Utilization Review

California Labor Code Section 4610 establishes the utilization review (UR) process:

> "Utilization review" means utilization review or utilization management functions that prospectively, retrospectively, or concurrently review and approve, modify, delay, or deny, based in whole or in part on medical necessity to cure and relieve, treatment recommendations by physicians..."

Utilization review organizations (UROs) apply MTUS guidelines to evaluate treatment requests from treating physicians. If a requested treatment is designated as "not recommended" in MTUS, the URO typically issues a denial or modification.

### Independent Medical Review (IMR)

California Labor Code Section 4610.5 establishes an Independent Medical Review (IMR) process for appealing UR denials. However, the IMR process has significant limitations:

1. IMR reviewers are bound by MTUS guidelines
2. The "insufficient evidence" designation is often treated as dispositive
3. Individual medical circumstances receive limited consideration
4. The process can take 30-60 days, during which the injured worker receives no treatment

### The Presumption of Correctness

Under the California workers' compensation system, MTUS guidelines carry significant weight. While not absolutely binding, they create a rebuttable presumption of correctness that places a heavy burden on injured workers and their physicians to justify deviations.

As one California appellate court noted: "The MTUS provides a presumptively correct standard for the treatment of injured workers." (See generally, the weight given to MTUS in workers' compensation proceedings.)

## C. The ACOEM Guidelines: Adoption and Implementation

### The Four Guidelines Analyzed

This report focuses on four major ACOEM guidelines adopted by California MTUS:

1. **Cervical and Thoracic Spine Disorders Guideline** (Effective October 17, 2018)
2. **Shoulder Disorders Guideline** (Effective July 14, 2025)  
3. **Elbow Disorders Guideline**
4. **Hand, Wrist, and Forearm Disorders Guideline**

These four guidelines cover the most common musculoskeletal work injuries and represent a comprehensive cross-section of MTUS policy.

### The Evidence Classification System

The ACOEM guidelines employ a hierarchy of evidence that privileges randomized controlled trials (RCTs) above all other forms of evidence. While RCTs are the gold standard for pharmaceutical research, their application to surgical procedures, physical therapy modalities, and diagnostic techniques is problematic for several reasons:

1. **Ethical limitations:** Sham surgery trials raise serious ethical concerns
2. **Practical limitations:** RCTs for rare conditions may be impossible
3. **Methodological limitations:** RCTs cannot capture long-term outcomes effectively
4. **Individual variation:** RCT averages may not apply to specific patients

The result is that many established, FDA-approved treatments receive "insufficient evidence" ratings not because they are ineffective, but because they have not been subjected to RCTs that meet ACOEM's methodological criteria.

### The "Insufficient Evidence" Designation

The crux of the constitutional problem lies in the "insufficient evidence" (Evidence I) designation. When a treatment receives this rating, the guideline typically issues either a "no recommendation" or "not recommended" classification—even for treatments that are:

- FDA-approved as safe and effective
- Standard of care in non-workers' compensation settings
- Covered by all other forms of insurance
- Routinely prescribed by physicians

This creates a perverse system where the absence of ACOEM-preferred evidence becomes the basis for denying treatments that federal regulators have already determined to be beneficial.

## D. The "Insufficient Evidence" Problem: Core Defect

### Contradiction with FDA Determinations

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the federal agency charged with protecting public health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of drugs, biological products, and medical devices. The FDA approval process involves:

1. Preclinical testing
2. Investigational New Drug (IND) applications
3. Phase I, II, and III clinical trials
4. New Drug Application (NDA) or Premarket Approval (PMA) review
5. Post-market surveillance

When the FDA approves a drug or clears a medical device, it has determined—based on substantial evidence—that the product is safe and effective for its intended use.

**The constitutional defect in MTUS is that it allows ACOEM's "insufficient evidence" designation to override the FDA's affirmative determination of safety and efficacy.**

This creates a system where:
- The FDA says: "This treatment is safe and effective"
- ACOEM says: "There is insufficient evidence to recommend this treatment"
- MTUS says: "Treatment denied"
- The injured worker suffers without care

### The Logical Fallacy

The "insufficient evidence" standard commits a fundamental logical error. It treats absence of evidence as evidence of absence. The proper scientific and legal conclusion from insufficient evidence is uncertainty—not a determination that treatment should be denied.

In statistical terms:
- **Null hypothesis:** The treatment is not effective
- **Insufficient evidence:** Failed to reject the null hypothesis
- **MTUS conclusion:** The treatment should be denied
- **Proper conclusion:** The treatment's effectiveness is uncertain

When applied to FDA-approved treatments, this logical error becomes a constitutional violation because it systematically denies proven treatments to one class of patients (injured workers) while allowing access for all others.

### Irrebuttable Presumption

Perhaps most troubling, the "insufficient evidence" designation functions as an irrebuttable presumption. Even when:

1. A treating physician provides individual evidence of medical necessity
2. Published studies support the treatment's efficacy
3. The patient has failed other treatments
4. Medicare/Medicaid covers the treatment for identical conditions

...the MTUS "insufficient evidence" designation typically prevails. This denies injured workers the individualized consideration required by due process and creates a classification based on group characteristics rather than individual circumstances.

# CHAPTER III: METHODOLOGY

## A. How the Analysis Was Conducted

This comprehensive report represents the culmination of extensive research and analysis of the MTUS/ACOEM guideline system. The methodology employed includes:

### Primary Document Review

The analysis began with a complete review of four major ACOEM guidelines adopted by California MTUS:

1. **ACOEM Cervical and Thoracic Spine Disorders Guideline** (2018)
2. **ACOEM Shoulder Disorders Guideline** (2025)
3. **ACOEM Elbow Disorders Guideline**
4. **ACOEM Hand, Wrist, and Forearm Disorders Guideline**

Each guideline was analyzed line-by-line to extract:
- Total number of treatment recommendations
- Evidence level assigned (A, B, C, I)
- Recommendation category (strongly recommended to strongly not recommended)
- FDA status of each treatment
- Specific conditions and indications

### FDA Status Verification

For each treatment designated as "not recommended," the FDA status was verified through:
- FDA Orange Book (for prescription drugs)
- FDA 510(k) Clearance Database (for medical devices)
- FDA Premarket Approval Database
- Historical FDA approval records

All treatments categorized as "FDA-approved" or "FDA-cleared" in this report have received affirmative FDA authorization for the relevant indication or a substantially equivalent indication.

### Legal Research

Constitutional analysis employed standard legal research methodology:
- Review of United States Supreme Court precedents on Equal Protection
- Review of federal circuit court decisions
- Review of state supreme court decisions on medical care access
- Review of law review articles and legal treatises
- Application of established constitutional tests to MTUS facts

## B. Data Sources and Primary Documents

### Primary Guideline Documents

The following official MTUS/ACOEM documents form the evidentiary foundation of this report:

1. **ACOEM Cervical and Thoracic Spine Disorders Guideline, Second Edition** (Reed Group, Ltd., 2020) - Adopted by California DWC effective October 17, 2018
2. **ACOEM Shoulder Disorders Guideline** (Reed Group, LLC, 2025) - Adopted by California DWC effective July 14, 2025
3. **ACOEM Elbow Disorders Guideline** (Reed Group, Ltd.)
4. **ACOEM Hand, Wrist, and Forearm Disorders Guideline** (Reed Group, Ltd.)

### Statutory and Regulatory Sources

- California Labor Code Sections 4600, 4610, 4610.5, 5307.27
- California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Sections 9792.20 et seq.
- 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. (Equal Protection Clause)
- FDA statutes: 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.

### Case Law Sources

- United States Supreme Court decisions from 1940-2025
- Federal Circuit Court decisions on equal protection and medical care
- State supreme court decisions on workers' compensation and constitutional rights
- California appellate decisions interpreting MTUS

## C. Statistical Methodology

### Data Extraction

From each guideline, the following data points were extracted:

1. **Total Recommendations:** Every distinct treatment recommendation (e.g., "MRI for acute radicular pain" is distinct from "MRI for chronic pain")
2. **Recommendation Category:** The strength of recommendation (strongly recommended to strongly not recommended)
3. **Evidence Level:** The quality of evidence (A, B, C, I)
4. **Treatment Type:** Diagnostic, pharmaceutical, surgical, therapeutic, etc.
5. **FDA Status:** Approved, cleared, not applicable, or investigational

### Calculation Methods

**Percentage Calculations:**
```
Percentage = (Category Count / Total Recommendations) × 100
```

**Cross-Guideline Analysis:**
- Simple summation for totals
- Weighted averages for percentage calculations
- Comparative ratios (e.g., strongly recommended : not recommended)

### Limitations on Data Precision

Some guidelines contain overlapping recommendations or nested hierarchies that make precise counting challenging. Where ambiguity exists:
- Conservative counting methods were employed (counting fewer rather than more denials)
- Lower-bound estimates were used for percentage calculations
- The term "X+" indicates that X is a minimum count with actual numbers likely higher

## D. Limitations and Scope

### Limitations

1. **Guideline Updates:** MTUS/ACOEM guidelines are periodically updated. This analysis reflects the versions current as of February 2026.

2. **Interpretive Discretion:** Some recommendation classifications involve interpretive judgment. This analysis employed consistent criteria throughout.

3. **Medical Complexity:** The determination of medical necessity for any individual patient requires clinical judgment. This report addresses systemic patterns, not individual cases.

4. **Evidentiary Standards:** The definition of "FDA-approved" employed here may not capture all regulatory nuances for every treatment.

### Scope

This report analyzes four major MTUS/ACOEM guidelines covering musculoskeletal conditions of the spine, shoulder, elbow, and hand/wrist/forearm. These guidelines were selected because:

1. They represent the most common work-related musculoskeletal injuries
2. They provide a comprehensive cross-section of MTUS policy
3. They demonstrate consistent patterns across different body regions
4. They contain sufficient detail for meaningful statistical analysis

This report does not analyze all MTUS guidelines. Additional guidelines (e.g., lower extremity, psychological conditions) may exhibit similar patterns but are not included in this analysis.
