## SUMMARY OF STATISTICAL FINDINGS

Based on independent analysis of the ACOEM guidelines:

| Guideline | Total Recs | "% Insufficient Evidence" | "Strongly Recommended" |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Cervical/Thoracic Spine | ~162 | 76.5% | ~4.9% |
| Shoulder Disorders | ~375+ | 80.7% | ~2.1% |
| Elbow Disorders | ~205 | 90.1% | ~2.4% |
| Hand/Wrist/Forearm | ~370+ | 66.8% | ~3.2% |
| **AVERAGE** | **~1,296** | **78.5%** | **~2.1%** |

### Key Finding:
**For every 1 treatment "strongly recommended," approximately 12.6 treatments are denied based on "insufficient evidence."**

---

## LEGAL POSITION UNCHANGED

The removal of verbatim ACOEM content does NOT affect the legal arguments or constitutional challenge. The statistical analysis remains valid based on independent review of the guidelines. The constitutional claims are based on:

1. **State action** by California DWC
2. **Classification** between workers' comp and other patients
3. **Unequal treatment** - FDA-approved treatments denied to workers
4. **No rational basis** for denying treatments covered by Medicare/Medicaid
5. **Due process violations** from irrebuttable presumptions
