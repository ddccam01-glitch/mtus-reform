SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
The following summary table contains general recommendations for evaluating and
managing hand, wrist, and forearm disorders from the Evidence-Based Hand, Wrist, and
Forearm Panel. These recommendations are based on critically appraised higher-quality
research evidence or, when such evidence was unavailable or inconsistent, on expert
consensus as required in ACOEM’s Methodology. Recommendations are made under the
following categories:
●
●
●
●
●

Not Recommended, “C” Level
Moderately Not Recommended, “B” Level
Strongly Not Recommended, “A” Level

The reader is cautioned to utilize the more detailed indications, specific appropriate
diagnoses, temporal sequencing, preceding testing or conservative treatment, and
contraindications that are elaborated in more detail for each test or treatment in the body
of this guideline in using these recommendations in clinical practice or medical
management. These recommendations are not simple “yes/no” criteria.

INTRODUCTION
OVERVIEW
Recommendations on assessing and treating adults with hand, wrist, and forearm disorders
are presented in this clinical practice guideline. Topics include the initial assessment and
diagnosis of patients with acute, subacute, and chronic hand, wrist, and forearm disorders
that are potentially work-related, identification of red flags that may suggest the presence
of a serious underlying medical condition, initial management, diagnostic considerations
and special studies to identify clinical pathology, work-relatedness, modified duty and
activity, and return to work, as well as further management considerations including

delayed recovery. The majority of peer-reviewed literature categorizes acute as <1 month
duration, subacute as 1 to 3 months duration, and chronic as >3 months duration. These
definitions have been adopted throughout this document.
Algorithms for patient management are included and schematize how to generally manage
acute, subacute, or chronic hand, wrist, and forearm disorders. It is important to realize that
there are few studies that evaluate patients with work-related hand, wrist, and forearm
disorders; therefore, studies that include different populations were used to develop the
recommendations. In addition, most studies that focus on pharmaceuticals, appliances, and
specific devices are industry sponsored. In certain areas, this may have made little
difference as the comparisons were between the medication and placebo and the results
may be stark. However, in other studies, the comparison groups may have been
suboptimally treated (e.g., a low dose of ibuprofen) and produced a bias in favor of the
medication or device. In addition, industry-sponsored studies have been shown to
frequently have better results and lower complication rates than studies conducted by
independent investigators.
The principal recommendations for assessing and treating patients with acute, subacute, or
chronic hand, wrist, or forearm symptoms are as follows:
●
The initial assessment focuses on detecting indicators of potentially serious disease,
termed red flags, which require urgent assessment and treatment as indicated.
●
The foci for treatment of patients with hand, wrist, or forearm symptoms include
optimal medical care, monitoring for complications, facilitating the healing process, assisting
stay at work or early return to work in a modified or full-duty capacity, and include surgical
intervention(s) when indicated.
●
Relieving discomfort can frequently and most safely be accomplished by modifying
activities and using either topical or systemic nonprescription analgesics.
●
Encourage patients recovering from hand, wrist, or forearm problems to stay at work
or consider early return to modified work as their condition permits.
●
Address occupational factors where the disorder is believed to be caused by work.
●
Address nonphysical factors (e.g., psychosocial, workplace, or socioeconomic
problems) in an effort to resolve delayed recovery (see Work Disability Prevention and
Management and Chronic Pain guidelines).

IMPACT
Hand, wrist, and forearm symptoms in the workforce are common problems presented to
clinicians and are among the five most common causes of reported work-related health
symptoms and workers’ compensation claims. According to 2010 US Census data, there was
an incidence rate of 67. 6 upper extremity fractures per 10,000 persons (1). In 2013, there
were 345,560 work-related upper extremity disorders for an incident rate of 32. 5 per
10,000 full-time workers (2). This was the leading cause of work-related injury (2), and it is
estimated that 20% of the population in any given month will complain of at least one type
of upper limb disorder (3). In 1998, a study involving more than 10,800 participants
concluded that 30. 5% had a self-reported neck or limb disorder (4). Results from another
study concluded that in 2000, 5. 3 out of every 1,000 workers would take an absence due to
sickness because of a musculoskeletal upper limb disorder; by 2004 this number had risen
to 6. 3 (5). These disorders account for nearly one-third (31. 4%) of the missed days of work

. They also account for about 7 to 8% of total lost workdays in workers’ compensation and
17 to 23% of cases and claims, ranking them in the top five for financial severity.

RISK AND CAUSATION
There are numerous occupational and non-occupational risk factors for hand, wrist, and
forearm (upper limb) musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) (6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21).
Most available quality evidence has been reported for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), with
sparse information on other disorders. While some risk factors (e.g., age, obesity (22,23),
diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome (24)) generally appear in common with most
MSDs, other risk factors do not appear in common across the disorders (e.g., low-density
lipoprotein (25), thyroid disorders, pregnancy). The lack of common risk factors across the
spectrum of disorders raises questions about the accuracy of generalizing any risk factor,
whether occupational or non-occupational across all disorders. Some of these
inconsistencies among studies may also be due to lack of statistical power to identify
relationships between these factors and upper extremity MSDs (22,23,26,27,28,29,30,31).

WORK-RELATEDNESS
Work-relatedness of hand, wrist and forearm MSDs is dependent on the precipitating
exposure(s). For acute, traumatic injuries (e.g., dislocations, true ligamentous sprains, mallet
finger, fractures), the work-relatedness is determined by whether the inciting event
occurred out of, or in the course of employment. Such determinations of work-relatedness
are rarely difficult or controversial.
Non-traumatic MSDs (e.g., CTS, tendinoses, tendinitis, trigger digit) are often difficult to
attribute to work to a medical degree of certainty. There are many retrospective studies of
these CTS and tendinoses. However, recently there are several prospective cohort studies
evaluating risk. One cohort in industrial and clerical workers found the greatest predictors of
upper extremity tendinosis were older age, body mass index over 30, shoulder or neck
discomfort at baseline, history of CTS and a higher shoulder posture rating (31). Another
prospective study of production workers reported associations of hand/wrist tendonitis to
repeated forceful pinching at work (32). A prospective study of automobile workers found
increased risks for incident cases of CTS included a history of wrist/hand/finger tendinoses,
diabetes mellitus, nonneutral wrist and elbow postures, lower social support, and greater
differences between baseline median and ulnar nerve peak latencies across the wrist (33).
One cohort study of repetitive work in Denmark found incidence rates over 3 to 4 years
were too low to compare the risk among those doing highly repetitive work (0. 62%) versus
more variable work (0.44%) (34). However, combinations of forceful and repetitive hand
activities at work as combined in the American Conference of Governmental Industrial
Hygienists hand-activity level have been found to increase risk of CTS in several prospective
studies (23,27,35,36,37,38,39), which is consistent with findings from numerous cross sectional
studies (9,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49). Attributable CTS risk from high-risk occupations in France is
estimated to range from 36 to 93% (50).
A thorough work history is crucial to a foundation for establishing work-relatedness.
Determining whether a complaint of a hand, wrist, or forearm disorder is related to work
requires a careful analysis and weighing of all associated or possible causal factors operative
at the time (19,51). A predominance of work factors suggests that worksite evaluation may be
appropriate.

A broad range of ergonomic surveys and instruments is available for measuring range of
activity, strain, weights, reach, frequency of motion, flexion, and extension, as well as
psychological factors such as organizational relationships and job satisfaction (e.g., Motion
Time Measurement analyses, ACGIH TLV for Hand Activity Level, Strain Index (52,53,54)). To
date, the TLV for HAL and Strain Index have been validated. Documentation of job physical
factors in conjunction with adverse health effects is often necessary to facilitate and
substantiate engineering and organizational changes (see individual sections for discussions
of work-relatedness of specific hand, wrist and forearm disorders).

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
INITIAL ASSESSMENT
Thorough medical and work histories as well as focused physical examinations (see General
Approach to Initial Assessment and Documentation Guideline) are sufficient for the initial
assessment of the majority of patients with a potentially work-related hand, wrist, or
forearm symptom(s). These evaluations should consider assessments of red flags, including
the possibility of referred pain to the hand, wrist, or forearm from a disorder in another part
of the body (e.g., cervical nerve root or heart). The absence of red flags largely rules out the
need for special studies, surgical intervention, or inpatient care the first 4 weeks, as during
this time, spontaneous recovery is common (provided any inciting workplace or other
factors are addressed).
Hand, wrist, and forearm symptoms can be classified into one of four working categories:
●
Potentially serious hand, wrist, or forearm condition: fracture, acute dislocation,
infection, neurovascular compromise, or tumor.
●
Mechanical disorders: derangements of the hand, wrist, or forearm related to acute
trauma, such as ligament sprain or muscle-tendon unit strain.
●
Degenerative disorders: resulting from aging or symptoms associated with use, or a
combination thereof, such as osteoarthrosis, other arthritides, tendinosis, or tenosynovitis.
●
Nonspecific disorders: occurring in the hand or wrist without clear, specific
pathophysiological correlates (most typically includes non-specific pain and sometimes
erroneously called “forearm tendinitis”).

HISTORY

Questionnaire here.
Asking the patient open-ended questions allows gauging of the need for further discussion
or make specific inquiries to obtain more detailed information. Hand dominance should be
noted. Consider initiating the clinical visit with an open-ended question such as “What can I
do for you?” to assure that the chief complaint is addressed. More specific questions for
hand, wrist, and forearm conditions include:
Symptoms:
●
What symptoms are you having? For how long?
●
Do you have pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, or limited movement?
●
For traumatic injuries: Did the area swell? If swollen, how quickly did it swell
(immediately or delayed)? Was the hand/finger deformed?

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Guided by the medical history, the physical examination includes:
●
General observation of the patient; and
●
Appropriate regional examination of upper limbs (hands, wrists, forearms, elbows,
arms, shoulders, and neck).
The general observation involves specification of which distal upper extremity is affected
and observation of how much the affected hand or arm is used versus how much activity is
avoided – e.g., does the patient shake the examiner’s hand or avoid all use of the hand or
arm? Does the patient hold the arm without using it? Are there differences in use
depending on whether there is active rather than casual observation and examination?
These aspects of the physical examination are under-rated, yet perhaps the most important
aspects for ascertainment of degrees of impairment and severity of the condition. Most
components of the examination are at least in part, subjective since the patient must exert
voluntary effort or state a response to a stimulus such as the sensory examination or
tenderness. In many cases of hand, wrist, or forearm problems, there are no strictly
objective findings. Exceptions include palpable trigger finger, ganglia, thenar atrophy, and
fracture-related deformities.
The physician should seek objective evidence of pathology that is consistent with the
patient’s symptoms. In some cases, careful examination will reveal one or more truly
objective findings, such as swelling, deformity, atrophy, reflex changes or spasm,
fasciculations, trophic changes, or ischemia. Regardless of whether completely objective
findings are present, all findings should be documented in the medical record.
The inter-related hand, wrist, forearm, arm, shoulder, and neck should be examined
individually and functionally together for observation of use, function, swelling, masses,
redness, deformity, asymmetry, or other abnormality. The examination should extend to the
proximal upper limb and neck. This examination may be followed by evaluating active and

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

27

passive range of motion within the patient’s limits of comfort with the area as relaxed as
possible for passive range of motion. Local tenderness may be accentuated by specific
motions or stresses on specific joints, and active muscle contraction may produce pain,
indicating a specific tendinosis. If this latter finding is on the dorsoradial side of the wrist, it
suggests a diagnosis of de Quervain’s tenosynovitis. Specific areas of decreased pinprick
sensation may indicate median or ulnar nerve compression. Flexing the wrist for 60 seconds
with elicitation of dysesthesias in the median innervated digits is considered a positive
Phalen’s test.
Several purported signs of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) have limited specific diagnostic
value and the history is believed to be of critical importance in securing a presumptive
diagnosis of CTS. The various signs for CTS show a broad range of positive predictive value
that is especially dependent on the patient population assessed. Physicians should primarily
rely on the clinical history as well as the physical examination. The most sensitive screening
methods appear to combine night discomfort, abnormal Katz hand diagram, and abnormal
sensibility by monofilament Semmes-Weinstein testing comparing affected with unaffected
nerve distributions. Hypalgesia in the median nerve distribution and thumb abduction
strength testing also have been found to be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of CTS. The
flick “sign” is another diagnostic tool. It reportedly has high sensitivity and specificity;
however, it is a historical finding rather than a true physical examination sign. The historical
feature is positive when a patient reports shaking his or her hand in an effort to relieve
paresthesias (55). The diagnostic utility of physical examination tests for CTS is unclear as the
underlying studies supporting meta-analyses have methods that are not well described.
Phalen’s maneuver is thought to be superior to Hoffmann-Tinel’s (“Tinel’s”) sign over the
median nerve, although neither perform particularly well (56).
Trigger finger (tendon) nodules may be palpable with both active and passive range of
motion. However, some patients only have tenderness over the flexor surface of the
metacarpal phalangeal joints, which may make this examination more difficult. A ganglion
may be present on either inspection, or for smaller ganglia, only on palpation. The severity
of symptoms on physical examination is usually the basis for aspiration or surgical excisions.
Fractures are most commonly discovered by deformity in the context of focal pain and an
inciting trauma history. Some occur without deformity and are only found on x-rays,
although most have focal tenderness on a careful palpatory examination.
The neurologic and vascular status of the hand, wrist, forearm, and upper limb should
include peripheral pulses, motor function, reflexes, and sensory status. Examining the neck
and cervical nerve root function is also recommended for most patients. For example, a C6
radiculopathy may cause tingling in the thumb and index finger and may affect the wrist
extensors while T1 radiculopathy can present as dysfunction of the intrinsic muscles of the
hand.

DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA
The criteria presented in the Diagnostic Criteria for Hand, Wrist, or Forearm Disorders table

For most patients presenting with non-traumatic hand, wrist, and forearm disorders, special
studies are not needed during the first 4 weeks. Most patients improve quickly, provided
red flag conditions are ruled out. Exceptions include the following:
●
In cases of wrist injury, with tenderness over the scaphoid (especially over the
scaphoid tubercle), but minimal other findings, a scaphoid fracture may still be present.
Initial radiographic images should be obtained, but may appear negative in the presence of
nondisplaced scaphoid fracture. If clinical symptoms continue, a re-evaluation with new
radiographs is advised in approximately 2 weeks.
●
An acute injury to the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb, accompanied by
tenderness on the ulnar side of the joint and laxity when that side of the joint is stressed
(compared to the other side), may indicate a gamekeeper’s thumb or rupture of the ulnar
collateral ligament of the MCP joint. Radiographic images may show a fracture or stress
views, if obtainable, may show laxity. The diagnosis may necessitate surgical repair of the
ligament and surgical referral is warranted.
Also, of note, a number of patients with hand, wrist, and forearm symptoms will have
associated disease such as diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, renal disease, and one or
more of the arthritides which are often heretofore undiagnosed. When medical history
and/or physical examination findings indicate or other risk factors are present, testing for
these or other comorbid condition(s) is recommended.

RED FLAGS
Potentially serious conditions for the hand, wrist, and forearm are listed in Table 3. Early
consultation by a hand or upper limb specialist, rheumatologist, or other relevant specialist
is recommended depending on the clinician's training and experience in dealing with the
particular disorder.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Initial treatment should generally be guided by implementing the strongest evidence-based
recommendations that are considered first-line interventions. Exceptions include those
treatments that are accepted as best practices, but have not been subjected to RCTs or
crossover trials (e.g., antibiotics for diabetics with “dirty” lacerations). Careful consideration
of the indications and limitations described in the full text for each recommendation is
critical to understanding the best application for each intervention. If treatment response is
inadequate (i.e., if symptoms and activity limitations continue), second- and third-line
recommendations may be considered. Physicians should consider the possibilities of
diagnosed and previously undiagnosed medical diseases such as diabetes mellitus,
hypothyroidism, and various arthritides. Adverse effects, cost, and clinician and patient
Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

preferences should be considerations in guiding the choice of recommendations. Part of the
initial treatment plan for all disorders should include patient education. For most diagnoses,
this is critical to successful treatment.

AUDITING / MONITORING CRITERIA
The clinician is recommended to assure:
1.
Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome are treated at some point with nocturnal,
cockup wrist splinting. Target >50%
2.
Patients undergoing carpal tunnel release have had a prior glucocorticosteroid
injection. Target >80%
3.
Patients with deQuervain’s are treated at the first appointment with
glucocorticosteroid injection. Target >40%
4.
Patients with trigger digit are treated at the first appointment with
glucocorticosteroid injection. Target >40%
5.
Trauma patients have tetanus status documented and compliance is assured with
CDC recommendations. Target 100%
6.
Patients with closed-injury mallet finger are treated with hyperextension splinting.
Target 100%

AMPUTATIONS AND INDICATIONS FOR REPLANTATION
The decision for amputation or replantation should be made by a physician who has training
and experience in treating amputations and replantations. The key for the initial clinician is
to reduce the warm ischemia time of the amputated part – the time without any
preparation of the amputated part. This is best done by washing the amputated part in
saline and wrapping it in saline soaked gauze, putting it into a plastic bag if possible, and
then placing it onto cardboard that is laid over ice in a cooler or jug. The part of the body
where the amputation has occurred should be covered with a compression dressing.
Vascular control is important. Attempts to use clamps to control bleeding often damage the
neurovascular structures and should not be used. Indicators that are used to suggest
replantation success include thumb amputation, multiple digit amputations, amputation at
a metacarpal amputation, almost any body part amputated in a child, wrist or forearm
amputation, and individual digit amputated distal to flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS)
insertion.
Contraindications may include ring avulsion injuries, severely crushed or mangled parts,
amputations at multiple levels, amputations in patients with other serious injuries or
diseases, arteriosclerotic vessels, mentally unstable patients, distal amputations (finger tip
injuries), individual finger in adult proximal to the FDS insertion and prolonged warm
ischemia. Prolonged warm ischemia is defined as more than 6 hours for proximal
replantations (wrist), and 12 hours for digits, although some physicians will attempt
replantation after 6 hours of warm ischemia, and 24 to 30 hours ischemia time (time from
amputation until replant with the digit stored in cool container as described above) for
digital replantations.

FOLLOW-UP CARE
Patients with potentially work-related hand, wrist, and forearm symptoms should generally
have a follow-up visit approximately every 3 (severe disorders) to 7 days (typical disorder
severity) to monitor function, medication use and/or a physical or occupational therapist
visit for counseling regarding contributing physical factor avoidance (e.g., reducing force,
avoiding static positions), sleep posture, and other concerns. More frequent follow-up is
usually required for patients who are not working. Care should be taken to answer
questions and make these sessions interactive so that the patient is involved in his or her
recovery including identifying potential barriers to recovery and return to normal function
and work. More specific guidance for follow-up visits may be included in the discussion of
each disorder topic.

EDUCATION
Part of the initial treatment plan for all disorders should include patient education. For most
diagnoses, this is critical to successful treatment.
EDUCATION FOR HAND, WRIST, OR FOREARM DISORDERS
Recommended
Education is recommended for select patients with hand, wrist, or forearm disorders.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
One or 2 appointments for educational purposes. Additional appointments may be needed
if education is combined with occupational or physical therapy treatments. Follow-up
educational visit(s) for more severe disorders as part of a progression towards normal
functional use is sometimes helpful.
Rationale
There are no quality studies specifically evaluating efficacy of patient education for utility or
necessity in treatment of hand, wrist, or forearm disorders. Yet, for many disorders (e.g.,
criticality of maintaining splinting of mallet finger, cast management, monitoring for signs of
infection) education appears essential. Some physicians accomplish this in the course of
extended patient visits, while others routinely refer patients to an occupational or physical
therapist for education. Regardless of the approach, a few appointments for educational
purposes are recommended for select patients. The number of appointments is dependent
on the diagnosis, severity of the condition, and co-existing conditions. Although education is
usually incorporated as part of the overall treatment plan, an additional 1 or 2
appointments for purely educational purposes may be helpful midway through a treatment
course for the more severely affected patient. In addition, education is low cost and thus is
recommended.

ERGONOMIC INTERVENTIONS
In order to facilitate recovery and prevent recurrence of distal upper extremity
musculoskeletal disorders, one may recommend work and activity modifications or
ergonomic redesign of the workplace (57). The employer’s role in accommodating activity
limitations and preventing further problems through ergonomic changes is crucial in
hastening the employee’s return to full activity. In some cases it may be desirable to
conduct an ergonomic analysis of the activities that may be contributing to symptoms. A
broad range of ergonomic surveys and instruments is available for estimating duration of
hand intensive activities, grasp repetition rates, pinch force, part or tool weights, reach
distance, frequency of motion, and wrist and hand postures, as well as psychological factors
such as organizational relationships and job satisfaction. Such detailed measures may be
necessary or useful for modifying activity, redesigning the workstation, or recommending
organizational and management relief. Such situations may call for referral to a certified
ergonomist or a human factors engineer. Alternate keyboard layouts have been used to
reduce disorders (58,59,60,61).
ERGONOMIC INTERVENTIONS FOR CTS AND COMMON DISTAL UPPER EXTREMITY
TENDINOSES
Recommended
In settings with combinations of risk factors (e.g., high force combined with high repetition),
ergonomic interventions are recommended to reduce risk factors for CTS and common
distal upper extremity tendinoses.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
Ergonomics interventions have been attempted in numerous occupational settings (Rempel
et al., 1999, Rempel et al., 2006, Verhagen et al., 2004, Rempel et al., 2012). Randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) of changes to manufacturing and production positions have not been

reported. However, a few RCTs have been reported of keyboard workstations (“office
ergonomics”) (Tittiranonda et al., 1999, Rempel et al., 1999, Rempel et al., 2006, Gerr et al.,
2002). There is one RCT regarding comparing a dental pick and finding lower pain in the
group with the lighter tool that has a wider handle (Rempel et al., 2012). There also have
been quality studies reported regarding participatory ergonomics programs. However, those
are mainly reports of patients with spine disorders in programs whose purpose is return to
work (see Low Back Disorders Guideline) (Arnetz et al., 2003). Despite the lack of quality
evidence in most settings, reductions in job physical factors, particularly high force, are
thought to be beneficial (Rempel et al., 2012, Herbert et al., 2000) (see Work-Relatedness).
There also are experimental studies of different equipment (Simmer-Beck et al., 2006),
although reductions in injuries have not been shown in quality studies.
There are no quality studies of ergonomic interventions for common distal upper extremity
MSDs in physically demanding occupations. Interventions which reduce forceful, repeated
pinching or alleviating localized compression by sharp objects may be theoretically helpful
(Sperling, 1951, Moore, 2000, Fahey et al., 1954, Compere, 1933, Hadji-Zavar, 1959, Hauck,
1923). Quality evidence is not available for effectiveness of ergonomic interventions on MSD
injury rates in typical manufacturing settings. However, given available evidence of risk
factors, interventions are recommended where there are combinations of risk factors;
particularly combined high force and high repetition (see Work-Relatedness).
Management/supervisor and labor/employee support are often necessary for optimal
success of these programs.
Quality evidence has reported no beneficial effects of the 90° typing posture (seated erect,
feet on floor, knees, hips, and elbow joints all at 90° angles), instead it has been found to
have the same injury rates as a “laid back” posture (Gerr et al., 2005). “Ergonomic
keyboards” involve a split design that produces a neutral wrist posture in comparison with a
standard keyboard that requires approximately 15° of ulnar deviation. However, those
keyboards have not been reported in quality studies to result in injury reductions, with the
exception of a physically split keyboard with sharply angled keyboard faces (Figure 3)
(Rempel et al., 1999). Evidence of superiority of these interventions is currently weak.
Clinicians should be aware that not all split designs are equivalent and there is evidence that
a widely split keyboard with sharply angled keyboard faces is not well tolerated
(Tittiranonda et al., 1999). Additional quality studies are needed. Forearm supports for
typing have been reported to result in fewer neck/shoulder symptoms (Rempel et al., 2006,
Conlon et al., 2008). Quality evidence suggests reductions in symptoms may be realized
from use of a trackball; however, clinicians should also be aware that there was a small,
non-statistically significant increase in pain complaints among a minority of users (Rempel et
al., 2006). This suggests that careful worksite or clinical observation, combined with
instructions to discontinue use if symptoms materially increase, may be desired during this
intervention. It also suggests that having multiple options available for workstations is
desirable. Quality evidence suggests reductions in neck/shoulder symptoms may be realized
through utilization of a forearm support (Rempel et al., 2006, Gerr et al., 2005).
Breaks from computer typing have been addressed in a low-quality study which reported
reductions in symptoms, but no additional benefit from utilizing exercise during breaks (van
den Heuvel et al., 2003). Various types of breaks have been utilized including stretching
breaks and exercise programs (Galinsky et al., 2007, Galinsky et al., 2000, Lee et al., 1992,

Carter et al., 1994, Fenety et al., 2002, Feuerstein et al., 2004, Henning et al., 1997,
Silverstein et al., 1988, Balci et al., 2004). Quality evidence supporting the efficacy of breaks
is weak, especially for symptomatic patients (van den Heuvel et al., 2003, Galinsky et al.,
2007, Galinsky et al., 2000). One low-quality randomized study among an apparently
asymptomatic population of temporary data-entry workers suggested fewer symptoms
among those taking breaks; however, compliance was low (ranging from 25 to 39%). Breaks
are not invasive, have no substantial adverse effects, are low cost, and do not appear to
impair productivity (van den Heuvel et al., 2003, Galinsky et al., 2000, Henning et al., 1997,
Balci et al., 2004, Balci et al., 2003, Floru et al., 1987, Kopardekar et al., 1994, McLean et al.,
2001, Sauter et al., 1992). Widespread use of these programs has not been reported in
quality studies; however, with no apparent significant cost impacts and studies suggesting
potential benefits, breaks are recommended for both primary prevention and treatment of
symptomatic patients.
While quality evidence is lacking for the use of ergonomics training, it is thought to be
beneficial in high-risk settings. One study suggested that training is inferior to a combination
of other interventions in an office setting (Rempel et al., 2006) and another found benefits
for the neck, but not distal upper extremity (Ketola et al., 2002). Thus, other benefits of
training may be possible. However, an RCT comparing wrist splinting with ergonomic
education found splinting superior (Werner et al., 2005). Thus, if there is a benefit, it may be
modest, and it is suggested that such training should consist of quality information.

FLEXOR HAND/WRIST TENDINOSES, OR FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION

(Tittiranonda et al., 1999). Additional quality studies are needed. Forearm supports for
typing have been reported to result in fewer neck/shoulder symptoms (Rempel et al., 2006,
Conlon et al., 2008). Quality evidence suggests reductions in symptoms may be realized
from use of a trackball; however, clinicians should also be aware that there was a small,
non-statistically significant increase in pain complaints among a minority of users (Rempel et
al., 2006). This suggests that careful worksite or clinical observation, combined with
instructions to discontinue use if symptoms materially increase, may be desired during this
intervention. It also suggests that having multiple options available for workstations is
desirable. Quality evidence suggests reductions in neck/shoulder symptoms may be realized
through utilization of a forearm support (Rempel et al., 2006, Gerr et al., 2005).
Breaks from computer typing have been addressed in a low-quality study which reported
reductions in symptoms, but no additional benefit from utilizing exercise during breaks (van
den Heuvel et al., 2003). Various types of breaks have been utilized including stretching
breaks and exercise programs (Galinsky et al., 2007, Galinsky et al., 2000, Lee et al., 1992,
Carter et al., 1994, Fenety et al., 2002, Feuerstein et al., 2004, Henning et al., 1997,
Silverstein et al., 1988, Balci et al., 2004). Quality evidence supporting the efficacy of breaks
is weak, especially for symptomatic patients (van den Heuvel et al., 2003, Galinsky et al.,
2007, Galinsky et al., 2000). One low-quality randomized study among an apparently
asymptomatic population of temporary data-entry workers suggested fewer symptoms
among those taking breaks; however, compliance was low (ranging from 25 to 39%). Breaks
are not invasive, have no substantial adverse effects, are low cost, and do not appear to
impair productivity (van den Heuvel et al., 2003, Galinsky et al., 2000, Henning et al., 1997,
Balci et al., 2004, Balci et al., 2003, Floru et al., 1987, Kopardekar et al., 1994, McLean et al.,
2001, Sauter et al., 1992). Widespread use of these programs has not been reported in
quality studies; however, with no apparent significant cost impacts and studies suggesting
potential benefits, breaks are recommended for both primary prevention and treatment of
symptomatic patients.
While quality evidence is lacking for the use of ergonomics training, it is thought to be
beneficial in high-risk settings. One study suggested that training is inferior to a combination
of other interventions in an office setting (Rempel et al., 2006) and another found benefits
for the neck, but not distal upper extremity (Ketola et al., 2002). Thus, other benefits of
training may be possible. However, an RCT comparing wrist splinting with ergonomic
education found splinting superior (Werner et al., 2005). Thus, if there is a benefit, it may be
modest, and it is suggested that such training should consist of quality information.

Rationale
Ergonomics interventions have been attempted in numerous occupational settings (Rempel
et al., 1999, Rempel et al., 2006, Verhagen et al., 2004, Rempel et al., 2012). Randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) of changes to manufacturing and production positions have not been
reported. However, a few RCTs have been reported of keyboard workstations (“office
ergonomics”) (Tittiranonda et al., 1999, Rempel et al., 1999, Rempel et al., 2006, Gerr et al.,
2002). There is one RCT regarding comparing a dental pick and finding lower pain in the
group with the lighter tool that has a wider handle (Rempel et al., 2012). There also have
been quality studies reported regarding participatory ergonomics programs. However, those
are mainly reports of patients with spine disorders in programs whose purpose is return to
work (see Low Back Disorders Guideline) (Arnetz et al., 2003). Despite the lack of quality
evidence in most settings, reductions in job physical factors, particularly high force, are
thought to be beneficial (Rempel et al., 2012, Herbert et al., 2000) (see Work-Relatedness).
There also are experimental studies of different equipment (Simmer-Beck et al., 2006),
although reductions in injuries have not been shown in quality studies.
There are no quality studies of ergonomic interventions for common distal upper extremity
MSDs in physically demanding occupations. Interventions which reduce forceful, repeated
pinching or alleviating localized compression by sharp objects may be theoretically helpful
(Sperling, 1951, Moore, 2000, Fahey et al., 1954, Compere, 1933, Hadji-Zavar, 1959, Hauck,
1923). Quality evidence is not available for effectiveness of ergonomic interventions on MSD
injury rates in typical manufacturing settings. However, given available evidence of risk
factors, interventions are recommended where there are combinations of risk factors;
particularly combined high force and high repetition (see Work-Relatedness).
Management/supervisor and labor/employee support are often necessary for optimal
success of these programs.
Quality evidence has reported no beneficial effects of the 90° typing posture (seated erect,
feet on floor, knees, hips, and elbow joints all at 90° angles), instead it has been found to
have the same injury rates as a “laid back” posture (Gerr et al., 2005). “Ergonomic
keyboards” involve a split design that produces a neutral wrist posture in comparison with a
standard keyboard that requires approximately 15° of ulnar deviation. However, those
keyboards have not been reported in quality studies to result in injury reductions, with the
exception of a physically split keyboard with sharply angled keyboard faces (Figure 3)
(Rempel et al., 1999). Evidence of superiority of these interventions is currently weak.
Clinicians should be aware that not all split designs are equivalent and there is evidence that
a widely split keyboard with sharply angled keyboard faces is not well tolerated
(Tittiranonda et al., 1999). Additional quality studies are needed. Forearm supports for

keyboards” involve a split design that produces a neutral wrist posture in comparison with a
standard keyboard that requires approximately 15° of ulnar deviation. However, those
keyboards have not been reported in quality studies to result in injury reductions, with the
exception of a physically split keyboard with sharply angled keyboard faces (Figure 3)
(Rempel et al., 1999). Evidence of superiority of these interventions is currently weak.
Clinicians should be aware that not all split designs are equivalent and there is evidence that
a widely split keyboard with sharply angled keyboard faces is not well tolerated

(Tittiranonda et al., 1999). Additional quality studies are needed. Forearm supports for
typing have been reported to result in fewer neck/shoulder symptoms (Rempel et al., 2006,
Conlon et al., 2008). Quality evidence suggests reductions in symptoms may be realized
from use of a trackball; however, clinicians should also be aware that there was a small,
non-statistically significant increase in pain complaints among a minority of users (Rempel et
al., 2006). This suggests that careful worksite or clinical observation, combined with
instructions to discontinue use if symptoms materially increase, may be desired during this
intervention. It also suggests that having multiple options available for workstations is
desirable. Quality evidence suggests reductions in neck/shoulder symptoms may be realized
through utilization of a forearm support (Rempel et al., 2006, Gerr et al., 2005).
Breaks from computer typing have been addressed in a low-quality study which reported
reductions in symptoms, but no additional benefit from utilizing exercise during breaks (van
den Heuvel et al., 2003). Various types of breaks have been utilized including stretching
breaks and exercise programs (Galinsky et al., 2007, Galinsky et al., 2000, Lee et al., 1992,
Carter et al., 1994, Fenety et al., 2002, Feuerstein et al., 2004, Henning et al., 1997,
Silverstein et al., 1988, Balci et al., 2004). Quality evidence supporting the efficacy of breaks
is weak, especially for symptomatic patients (van den Heuvel et al., 2003, Galinsky et al.,
2007, Galinsky et al., 2000). One low-quality randomized study among an apparently
asymptomatic population of temporary data-entry workers suggested fewer symptoms
among those taking breaks; however, compliance was low (ranging from 25 to 39%). Breaks
are not invasive, have no substantial adverse effects, are low cost, and do not appear to
impair productivity (van den Heuvel et al., 2003, Galinsky et al., 2000, Henning et al., 1997,
Balci et al., 2004, Balci et al., 2003, Floru et al., 1987, Kopardekar et al., 1994, McLean et al.,
2001, Sauter et al., 1992). Widespread use of these programs has not been reported in
quality studies; however, with no apparent significant cost impacts and studies suggesting
potential benefits, breaks are recommended for both primary prevention and treatment of
symptomatic patients.
While quality evidence is lacking for the use of ergonomics training, it is thought to be
beneficial in high-risk settings. One study suggested that training is inferior to a combination
of other interventions in an office setting (Rempel et al., 2006) and another found benefits
for the neck, but not distal upper extremity (Ketola et al., 2002). Thus, other benefits of
training may be possible. However, an RCT comparing wrist splinting with ergonomic
education found splinting superior (Werner et al., 2005). Thus, if there is a benefit, it may be
modest, and it is suggested that such training should consist of quality information.

CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
OVERVIEW
CTS is the most common and widely known of the entrapment neuropathies in which the
body’s peripheral nerves are compressed or traumatized (6,62,63,64,65,66), affecting an
estimated 4 to 10 million Americans (64). Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) occurs when
symptoms occur that are attributable to abnormal median nerve compression within the
carpal tunnel – a narrow, rigid passageway of ligament and bones at the base of the hand,
which houses the median nerve and flexor tendons. The median nerve supplies sensations
to the palmar aspect of the thumb, index, middle and radial half of the ring finger, as well as
the dorsal segment of each of those four digits from the DIP distally, but not the fifth digit,
as well as innervation to some small muscles (lateral two lumbricals, opponens pollicis,
Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

51

abductor policis brevis and flexor pollicis brevis.) in the hand that allow the fingers and
thumb to move. Often, the condition arises without apparent cause (6,7,67). Patients who
have open injuries, unstable fractures, wrist fractures, or acute gout attack that results in
acute CTS require immediate referral to a surgeon since improvement may only be obtained
through surgery. Sometimes, synovial thickening around tendons or other swelling narrow
the carpal tunnel and cause the median nerve to become variously compressed or enlarged
through poorly understood processes. The result may be tingling, numbness, pain, or
weakness in the digits. Tingling and numbness are essential symptoms. Pain is not an
essential symptom and it may indicate other conditions, but if present, may also radiate
proximally.
There are numerous occupational and non-occupational risk factors for CTS, as well as other
hand, wrist, and forearm musculoskeletal disorders (9,18,19,21,40,41,43,45,68). Many studies on CTS
have not used objective measures that included electrodiagnostic testing in case definitions,
rather they relied solely on symptoms or combinations of symptoms and physical
examination findings (e.g., Hoffman-Tinel’s sign) (9).
A thorough work history is crucial to a foundation for establishing work-relatedness (see
Work-Relatedness Guideline for a method to determine work-relatedness). Nonoccupational risk factors that have been most consistently identified in numerous studies
for CTS include age, gender, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, and wrist
depth/width ratio (6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,20,50,68,69,70,71,72). Physicians should also be aware of
the high prevalence of CTS in the general population, its strong relationship with age, and
the relatively high prevalence of nerve conduction abnormalities in the population, some of
which are asymptomatic (73). Determining whether a complaint of a hand, wrist, or forearm
symptoms are related to work requires a careful analysis and all associated or possible
causal factors operative at the time must be weighed (19,51). A predominance of work factors
suggests that worksite evaluation is likely appropriate and intervention may also be
appropriate. A careful ergonomic assessment, work management, and other preventive
measures are also suggested when a cluster of cases in a work group occurs.
Based on recent prospective studies, the sustained or repeated application of forceful
pinching or gripping is thought to be the most potent work-place activity related risk factor
for CTS and hand or wrist tendinosis, particularly when combined with high rates of
repetition (23,27,32,33,35,36,37,38). The risk appears present when pinch forces are greater than 10
N (1kg) (32,36,41). Carpal tunnel syndrome risk appears most strongly increased in jobs
involving high-force gripping such as meat processing, manufacturing, and farming (50,74,75,76).
Keyboard use is often a highly repetitive, but very low-force task with very different physical
exposures than non-computer work and having many mostly retrospective epidemiological
studies previously reported (34,72,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90). Prospective cohort studies
have failed to find associations between CTS and keyboard use (72,78,91,92), however, one of
these studies reported increased risk with increased mouse use in both its baseline/crosssectional analyses and cohort analyses (78). Case-control studies have reported conflicting
results, with one reporting reduced risk with increased hours spent typing (80) and one
reporting increased risk with typing more than 4 hours per day (87). In several large
prospective studies, increasing hours of computer work was associated with tendinosis, de
Quervain’s disease, and non-specific hand, wrist, forearm and elbow, neck and shoulder
pain (91,93,94). Split keyboards have been associated with reduction in pain and disorders
(95,96)
. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to relate keyboard or computer activities to CTS.

RISK AND CAUSATION
There are numerous purported risk factors for CTS (see Table 2), although many have not
been confirmed in prospective studies as true independent risk factors. Evidence appears
most consistent in the retrospective studies for age, obesity, female gender, diabetes
mellitus, and combinations of forceful and repetitive grasping (6-18,40-42,68,97,98). Recent
prospective cohort studies of CTS have confirmed the above five factors as apparently true
risk factors, including repeated high force grasping, overweight or obesity, female gender,
and psychosocial factors (23,28,29,35-38,99).
Table 2 is based on prospective, cross-sectional, and case-control studies, case series, and
case reports. Note, this table is not meant to be all inclusive.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
Patients with CTS typically have a constellation of symptoms with some variation in clinical
presentations (63,100,101) and a lack of a criterion standard (65). Symptoms most typically start
gradually in the thumb, index, and middle fingers with tingling, numbness, or burning (66,100).
Symptoms may also include subjective hand swelling (102). Symptoms often first appear
during sleep, possibly due to sleeping with wrists flexed, edema, venous pooling or a
combination of factors. The patient may awaken with the desire to “shake out” the hand or
wrist. As symptoms worsen, patients may experience tingling during the day particularly
after a sustained hand grasp (such as when using a steering wheel or hand tool). Wrist
flexors are innervated by the median nerve proximal to the wrist. However, decreased
thumb and grip strength sometimes occurs and may make it difficult to form a firm fist,
sustain grasp particularly of small objects, or perform other manual tasks. In chronic,
advanced, and/or untreated cases, the muscles of the thenar eminence may atrophy. Some
severely affected patients are unable to differentiate between hot and cold. Symptoms are
most commonly documented through detailed recording of symptoms and digits affected or
with a hand symptom diagram (101,103,104,105,106,107). With the Katz hand diagram, the patient
is provided with a form that shows outlines of the arms, and the palmar and dorsal surfaces
of the hands. The patient identifies areas of discomfort on the diagrams and characterizes
the symptoms (e.g., pain, numbness, tingling, or other). The results are scored by the
clinician as “probable,” “possible,” or “unlikely,” depending upon specified criteria.
Patients with CTS should have paresthesias (tingling and/or numbness) (65,100,101) but pain in
the wrist hand or fingers may or may not be present. In patients with only wrist or hand
pain without paresthesias, a diagnosis other than carpal tunnel syndrome may be present.
Symptoms of tingling, numbness and pain in the median nerve distribution of the hand are
common in the general population (prevalence approximately 14 to 37%). However, based
on clinical examination and electrophysiologic testing, CTS prevalence rates range from 2.
7% to as high as 13. 0% (22,33,108-118) while the incidence rate for working populations is near
2. 3 per 100 person-years (119). Differences in diagnostic criteria and population
characteristics between these studies may play a role in the differences in reported CTS
prevalence (120).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The physical examination is particularly helpful for assuring other condition(s) are not
present. Some believe the physical examination is highly useful (121) while others suggest the
physical examination findings are of limited use in securing a diagnosis as compared with a
careful history, and add little to a careful history combined with electrodiagnostic evidence
(56,65)
. A recent analysis of signs of carpal tunnel syndrome reported considerable
methodological issues, including spectrum biases that likely result in overstatement of the
clinical utility of common tests for CTS (122). Clinical testing for CTS may include several items
outlined below. The following describes pertinent history and clinical testing:
●
Thenar atrophy – Thenar eminence should appear small compared with the
hypothenar eminence and the contralateral hand. This is an advanced sign.
●
Hand sensibility - Multiple tests are tested to attempt to determine clinical
sensibility. These include Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test, Ten Test, 2-point
discrimination, paper clips and various devices. However, sensibility (ability to sense or

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

55

detect cutaneous stimuli) decreases with age resulting in challenges in interpreting results.
Comparison with unaffected digits or the opposite hand is often helpful (123,124,125,126).
●
Hypoalgesia in the median nerve territory – Diminished ability to perceive painful
stimuli in the median nerve distribution (e.g., palmar aspect of the index finger compared
with the ipsilateral fifth digit).
●
Monofilament test – A test involving nylon monofilaments that collapse at specific
amounts of force when pushed perpendicularly against the palm or fingers. A positive test
results when a filament of greater than normal size is required in order for its application to
be perceived by the patient.
●
Vibration Testing – Diminished ability to perceive vibratory sensations using a
standard vibrating tuning fork comparing the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger
to ipsilateral fifth finger.
●
Weak thumb abduction strength – Weakness of resisted abduction (i.e., palm
horizontal, thumb lifted as vertically as possible, then patient resists examiner pushing the
thumb down towards the index finger).
●
Hoffmann-Tinel’s Sign (“Tinel’s”) – Up to 6 taps of a reflex hammer or tip of
examiner’s finger to the soft tissue overlying the carpal tunnel. A positive test occurs when
the taps cause paresthesias or shooting pain in the median nerve distribution (127).
●
Phalen Sign – As originally described, flexion of the wrist by having the examiner
passively flex the wrists of the patient for up to 60 seconds (128). Clinically, this is more
commonly performed by having the patient press the dorsal aspect of both hands together
with approximately 90° of flexion for 60 seconds. It is unclear if these two means of
performing this sign result in different sensitivities and specificities. A positive test produces
paresthesias in the distribution of the affected median nerve.
●
Carpal Compression Test – The examiner holds the supinated wrist in both hands,
flexes the wrist 45° and applies direct, even pressure over the transverse carpal ligament
with both thumbs for up to 30 seconds. A positive test is indicated by tingling or paresthesia
into the thumb, index finger, and middle and lateral half of ring finger within 30 seconds
(129)
.
●
Tourniquet Test – Paresthesias developing in the distribution of the median nerve
when a blood pressure cuff is inflated above systolic pressure for 60 seconds.
●
Hand volume – Hand volume change measured by water displacement in a
graduated cylinder.

DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA
Patients with a presumptive diagnosis of CTS should have both paresthesias in the median
nerve distribution and symptoms that are either nocturnal or provoked. Paresthesias are
tingling or numbness in a median nerve distribution, (vibrotactile testing has been utilized to
attempt to objectify sensory findings, but appears to not perform particularly well) (130)
generally involving at least two median nerve-served digits (they may also have pain – pain
is not the primary symptom, there is also some evidence for more non-neurologic pain in
workers’ compensation patients (131) – or burning in a median nerve distribution, but should
have paresthesias); and 2) symptoms that are provoked either nocturnally or with sustained
grasp (e.g., holding a tool, steering wheel or newspaper).
Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CTS should have both symptoms as with a
presumptive diagnosis above, and either: 1) a confirmatory electrodiagnostic study (EDS)

56

interpreted as consistent with CTS, or 2) largely or completely resolved symptoms with
injection of a glucocorticosteroid.
The differential diagnosis for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) particularly includes pronator
syndrome; C6 and C7 cervical radiculopathies; and other neurological entrapments located
between the spinal cord and median nerve in the carpal canal including thoracic outlet
syndrome, diabetic neuropathy, neuropathy from alcohol, other systemic neuropathies,
stroke, other cerebrovascular events, and central nervous system tumors. Most other
causes may be eliminated or the probability reduced by conducting a careful history,
physical exam, or focused testing.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
ELECTRODIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
Appropriate electrodiagnostic studies (EDS), including nerve conduction studies (NCS), may
help differentiate CTS from other conditions such as cervical radiculopathy, other median
nerve neuropathies, or ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (65,109,112,115,116,132-174). In select or
more difficult cases, especially if cervical radiculopathy is a concern, electromyography
(EMG) studies should be incorporated (132). NCS and EMG may be normal particularly in
some mild cases of CTS. If EDS are negative, tests may be repeated later in the course of
treatment if symptoms persist. It is also important to recognize that electrodiagnostic
studies are abnormal in a large proportion of patients who are without symptoms and thus
without CTS (105). Thus, EDS testing in a patient with a low pre-test probability of CTS may
result in inappropriate diagnosis of CTS. EDS has been purportedly not useful in diagnosing
clear-cut CTS cases (175).
The American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine, the American Academy of
Neurology, and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation jointly
published a practice parameter for electrodiagnostic studies in CTS (175). However, the
quality of EDS varies widely in practice (176) and this practice guideline is sometimes not
adhered to, requiring the treating physician to be familiar with these issues to better
interpret the findings in a clinical context. Additionally, cut-off points for abnormal values
have yet to be fully standardized and the correlations between symptom severity and EDS
severity are not uniformly strong (66,100). In patients with suspected CTS where
electrodiagnostic confirmation would alter treatment plans, the following EDS studies are
recommended (in the majority of these studies, the hand temperature should be 32°C or
warmer) (132):
1. To ensure accurate testing, warm the hands if they are <30°C. If possible, it is best to keep
the temperatures above 32°C as measured at the hand or fingers (177).
2. Perform a median sensory NCS across the wrist with a conduction distance of 13 to 14cm.
If the result is abnormal, compare the result of the median sensory NCS to the result of a
sensory NCS of one other adjacent sensory nerve in the symptomatic limb.
3. If the initial median sensory NCS across the wrist has a conduction distance greater than
8cm and the result is normal, one of the following additional studies is recommended:
a. Comparison of median-sensory- or mixed-nerve conduction across the wrist over a
short (7 to 8cm) conduction distance to the ulnar sensory-nerve conduction across
the wrist over the identical 7 to 8cm conduction distance, or
Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

57

b. Comparison of median sensory across the wrist with ipsilateral radial or ulnar
sensory conduction across the wrist, or
c. Comparison of median sensory or mixed nerve conduction through the carpal
tunnel to sensory or mixed NCS of proximal or distal segments of the ipsilateral
median nerve.
4. Motor conduction study of the median nerve recording from the thenar muscle and of
one other ipsilateral nerve with distal latency.
5. Optional comparisons may include ipsilateral median-ulnar motor nerve distal latencies
and median-ulnar motor conduction differences.
6. Needle EMG is optional for some cases. It is primarily used for evaluation of cervical
radiculopathy, as well as axonopathies (175).
7. If abnormal in the index limb, then measuring the contralateral limb is helpful for both
comparison and for diagnosis of systemic disorders.
ELECTRODIAGNOSTIC STUDIES FOR DIAGNOSIS AND PRE-OPERATIVE ASSESSMENT OF
CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
Recommended
Quality electrodiagnostic studies (EDS) are recommended to assist in securing a firm
diagnosis for those patients without a clear diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). EDS
are also recommended to objectively secure a diagnosis of CTS prior to surgical release in
workers compensation patients (Buch-Jaeger et al., 1994). If EDS is elected, needle EMG is
important to differentiate between cervical radiculopathy and entrapment, although it is
not required in all CTS cases. EDS of the contralateral limb may be necessary in some cases.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Moderate
Frequency/Dose/Duration
A repeat study at 3 months may be indicated if the first study was not diagnostic and CTS is
still suspected. EDS is also indicated at 8-12 weeks post-operatively in cases where results
are inadequate and/or symptoms have recurred.
Rationale
EDS are the only unequivocally objective measures of median nerve function (Rempel et al.,
1998, Jablecki et al., 2002, Buch-Jaeger et al., 1994, Atroshi et al., 2003, Kuntzer, 1994,
Nathan et al., 1993). However, there are both false-positive and false-negative test results
that demand that the physician understand the pre-test probabilities and be capable of
interpreting the results and placing them in an appropriate clinical context. For example,
EDS should not be ordered in settings where the clinical history suggests a low likelihood of
CTS because the probability of a false-positive test result may be well above 50%. EDS are
primarily of assistance in: 1) identifying an anatomic location of nerve conduction slowing;
2) identifying objective evidence for alternate diagnostic considerations (e.g., cervical

58

radiculopathy, axonopathies); and 3) quantifying nerve function to assure the physician that
an operative state such as CTS is present. EDS are not invasive or minimally invasive
(depending on whether the EMG component is required), have minimal adverse effects, and
are high cost. They are recommended for evaluation of select cases, especially if the
diagnosis is unclear or surgery is planned.
There are other commercial diagnostic products (Dale et al., 2015, Elkowitz et al., 2005,
American Association of Electrodiagnostic et al., 1999); and some studies have suggested
there may have sufficient accuracy (Leffler et al., 2000, Dale et al., 2015), however, there
are relatively few studies available and thus the use of these studies may be currently
limited to where there is both no concern about radiculopathy and other disorders and the
EDS test is not readily available (e.g., due to distance geographical issues). Thus, there is no
recommendation for or against their use.

ELECTRODIAGNOSTIC STUDIES FOR INITIAL EVALUATION OF CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
Not Recommended
Electrodiagnostic studies (EDS) are not recommended for initial evaluation of most patients
with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), who have a confirming history and clinical signs because
they do not change the management of the condition. EDS are also not recommended prior
to glucocorticosteroid injection because a good history and clinical suspicion is believed to
be sufficient to warrant the intervention.

Multiple moderate-quality comparative studies report that ultrasound does not outperform

PROGRESS MONITORING
The clinical evaluation and progress of patients is most commonly monitored qualitatively
from appointment to appointment. Particularly, physicians seek information regarding the
degree to which symptoms are present and whether the patient believes there has been
improvement. However, there are several instruments that may be utilized for monitoring
the progress of patients with CTS (241). These include the DASH (242-263) and Boston Carpal
Tunnel Questionnaire (133,214,242,243,246,247,251-284). Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire
(MHQ) has been used in many studies as a measurement outcome of CTS (254,262,266,285). The
Short Form-36 (SF-36) (249,255,264), the Flinn Performance Screening Tool (FPST) (286), the
Patient Evaluation Measure questionnaire (PEM) (248,263), the Amadio questionnaire (259), the
Historical-objective-distribution based scale (Hi-Ob-Db) (267,279), and the Alderson-McGali
hand function questionnaire (AMHFQ) (264) have been used to diagnose CTS. VAS symptoms
and pain scores may also be used (249,253,264) even though many patients with CTS have no
pain. Functional status scores (133,242,255,259,265,270,274,275,277,280,282,286-288) and Global Symptom
Scores (289) are also used, particularly in some research studies. Grip strength
(248,253,264,271,272,277,284,290,291-293)
may be utilized. However, patients who have mild symptoms
generally have normal grip strength. All of these questionnaires are subjective and strength
measures are effort-dependent, although the strength measures attempt to provide a
quantitative measure that may help to gauge improvement over time especially postoperatively (242,246,252,266,274,282,289,294-297).

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
ACTIVITY MODIFICATION AND EXERCISE
Various exercise regimens have been utilized to treat patients with CTS, most commonly
tendon-gliding and nerve-gliding exercises (298-305). These exercises are thought to help
prevent adhesion formation (303,306,307,308). Yoga has been used to treat CTS (309), although its
main uses have been in treating spine pain and other more widespread MSDs (see Chronic
Pain and Low Back Disorders Guidelines).
Wrist splinting has been utilized to treat CTS (59,299,309-321). A precise mechanism of action is
unclear, although it is believed to prevent hyperflexed postures, particularly while sleeping,
that provoke symptoms (316,318). Placement of the wrist in functional neutral posture
(approximately 15° of extension) is most typically performed (59); however, most studies do
not specify the posture and at least one study utilized a neutral posture of 0° (302) which
actually is a modest degree of flexion. Whether those differences in postures are clinically
meaningful is unknown.
EXERCISES FOR PATIENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT DEFICITS
Recommended
Exercise is recommended for the postoperative rehabilitation of patients with carpal tunnel
syndrome (CTS) who have significant deficits.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Post-operative CTS patients with significant functional deficits.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Appointments scheduled generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there have been functional
improvements yet there are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6
appointments is often helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once
a week appointments) may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more
severe, and there is ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of
visits (e.g., increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work
abilities, increased duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are
appropriate when there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent
objective functional gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the
therapy.
Indications for discontinuation

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

65

Completion of a course of therapy of approximately 6 visits. Independence in performing
exercises at home. Non-compliance.
Rationale
There are multiple moderate quality studies, but none has clearly found benefit of exercises,
including tendon-gliding, for treatment of CTS (Abdolrazaghi 2023). Two moderate-quality
studies suggest there is no statistically significant incremental benefit from adding tendongliding exercises to wrist splinting (Akalin et al., 2002) (Abdolrazaghi 2023) although modest
trends towards benefit appear present in both studies. Another moderate-quality study
found a combination of tendon-gliding exercise with ultrasound and splinting superior to
two other combinations (Baysal et al., 2006). Thus, it is unclear if there is an independent
benefit from tendon-gliding exercises. Additionally, as many believe that physical activity is
a risk factor for CTS, the logic of performing exercises for treatment is somewhat dissonant.
However, exercise programs are not invasive, have few if any adverse effects, and are low
cost if performed independently after receiving initial instructions. Exercise would be
advised for those with functional deficits, such as grip strength (see Post-Operative
Rehabilitation section for guidance that may be adapted for such patients).

YOGA FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC CTS
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of yoga for treatment of acute, subacute,
or chronic CTS.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There is one moderate-quality RCT that suggested improvements in grip strength; however,
the comparative population had an inactive splint for treatment which may have created an
artificial difference in grip strength (Garfinkel et al., 1998). While yoga appears beneficial for
treatment of spine patients (Williams et al., 2009), there is no evidence of efficacy for distal
upper extremity MSDs. Yoga is not invasive, has low potential for adverse effects, and is low
cost. Compliance and adherence are reportedly not good, as patient motivation must be
high and there is much self-selection in studies assessing yoga’s efficacy.
Evidence

Cochrane Library without date limits using the following terms: yoga and carpal tunnel
syndrome, CTS, median nerve neuropathy, median neuropathy, meadian nerve disease,

Frequency/Dose/Duration
Wrist splints are recommended to be worn while sleeping (Werner et al., 2005, Gerritsen et
al., 2002, Premoselli et al., 2006, Walker et al., 2000, Manente et al., 2001). There is no
recommendation for or against the use of splints during the daytime; however, splints
theoretically increase force requirements needed to perform some jobs and have
demonstrated alterations in other upper extremity postures (King et al., 2003); thus, they
may have a relative contraindication to daytime use. However, one study testing nocturnal
versus full-time use suggested modestly better results in electrodiagnostic parameters, but
not symptoms, with full-time use (Walker et al., 2000). There are numerous models and
trials using different types of splints with all trials showing benefits and head-to-head trials,
suggest there is, as yet, no identified optimal type of splint (Brininger et al., 2007, De Angelis
et al., 2009, Storey P, 2013).
Indications for discontinuation
Splints should be re-adjusted if no response within 2 weeks of starting treatment,
particularly to assure that the patient is wearing them properly as well as to assess fit. If
there is only partial improvement and symptoms are sufficient for additional treatment,
consideration of glucocorticosteroid injection and/or electrodiagnostic testing is indicated. If
there is no improvement, splints should be discontinued and the accuracy of the diagnosis
re-evaluated.
Rationale
Wrist splints have been shown to be effective compared to not splinting (Premoselli et al.,
2006, Manente et al., 2001) or to ergonomic education (Werner et al., 2005). Splinting is
also comparable to and in some measures superior to oral steroids (Mishra et al., 2006).
One trial found splinting combined with NSAIDs comparable to glucocorticosteroid injection
(Celiker et al., 2002). Both trials evaluating exercises and splinting used splinting for all
subjects, precluding a comparison between those interventions. One trial suggested no
superiority of a combination of tendon-gliding exercises combined with splinting combined
with splinting alone (Akalin et al., 2002). Another trial suggested modest superiority of
surgery over 18 months of follow-up; however, there may have been a slight bias in favor of
surgery due to a baseline trend towards longer duration of symptoms in the splint group
(Gerritsen et al., 2002), particularly in light of a subsequent report that those with shorter
duration of symptoms had superior results with splinting (Gerritsen et al., 2003). Another
trial compared splinting versus injection versus surgery and found few differences except for
a modest trend favoring surgery over the long term (Ucan et al., 2006). A trial conducted in
the Netherlands comparing splinting with surgery found little clinical difference, but
concluded surgery was more cost-effective (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006). A recent report
suggests splinting is more likely to be effective in those with milder symptoms of less than 1year duration (Gerritsen et al., 2003). Wrist splints are not invasive, have no significant
adverse effects, and are not costly. They are moderately recommended for treatment of
CTS.

MEDICATIONS
NSAIDS AND ACETAMINOPHEN
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used to address beliefs in
inflammatory mechanisms of CTS or to manage pain associated with CTS (322,323,324,325,326,327)
(see Chronic Pain Guideline for detailed discussion on mechanisms of action, classes of
medications, adverse effects, etc.). Acetaminophen and paracetamol are sometimes utilized
to treat CTS, although their effects on cyclooxygenase activity are minimal and they are not
anti-inflammatory.
NSAIDS FOR SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
Not Recommended
NSAIDs are not recommended as a primary treatment for subacute or chronic carpal tunnel
syndrome (CTS) (Chang et al., 1998).
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
See manufacturer’s recommendations.
Rationale
While NSAIDs have been widely used to attempt to address a theoretical inflammatory basis
for CTS and/or to treat pain associated with CTS, the one quality study comparing an NSAID
to placebo found no benefit from the NSAID (Chang et al., 1998). This same study also found
no difference between NSAIDs and diuretics which also appear ineffective. There is also no
quality evidence that there is a difference among NSAIDs (see Hip and Groin Disorders
Guideline). Thus, there is quality evidence that NSAIDs do not have a role in the treatment
of typical cases of CTS (Chang et al., 1998). Cases of CTS thought to have an inflammatory
component (e.g., inflammatory rheumatoid conditions) are reasonable exceptions where
NSAID and/or acetaminophen use may be appropriate. Other studies comparing NSAIDs

70

with manipulation plus ultrasound (Davis et al., 1998) and lidocaine patch (Nalamachu et al.,
2006) did not find benefits of NSAIDs compared with those treatments. A trial combining
splinting (which appears effective) plus NSAID versus glucocorticosteroid injection did not
find one arm to be superior (Celiker et al., 2002). While some patients may benefit from
NSAIDs, evidence is lacking that there is any beneficial effect of NSAIDs for treatment of CTS
and aggregate analyses of these studies also suggest NSAIDs are ineffective (Chang et al.,
1998, Davis et al., 1998, Nalamachu et al., 2006). Acetaminophen is thought to also be
ineffective. NSAIDs are not invasive and have low adverse effects profiles, particularly when
used for short courses in occupational populations. Generic or over-the-counter
formulations are low cost. However, there is quality evidence that other interventions are
effective. A short course of an over-the-counter NSAID may be reasonable for select
patients; however, routine use of NSAIDs for treatment of CTS is not recommended. Select
patients with acute CTS due to unaccustomed forceful use may be potential candidates for
treatment with NSAIDs; however, that population has not been studied in quality trials.
There is one high-quality study in post-operative patients indicating that for post-operative
pain management, naproxen is superior to acetaminophen, which in turn is superior to
placebo (Husby et al., 2001). NSAIDs and acetaminophen may also facilitate the
rehabilitation process without the impairments associated with opioids. Thus, NSAIDs and
acetaminophen are recommended for post-operative pain management.

and aggregate analyses of these studies also suggest NSAIDs are ineffective (Chang et al.,
1998, Davis et al., 1998, Nalamachu et al., 2006). Acetaminophen is thought to also be
ineffective. NSAIDs are not invasive and have low adverse effects profiles, particularly when
used for short courses in occupational populations. Generic or over-the-counter
formulations are low cost. However, there is quality evidence that other interventions are
effective. A short course of an over-the-counter NSAID may be reasonable for select
patients; however, routine use of NSAIDs for treatment of CTS is not recommended. Select
patients with acute CTS due to unaccustomed forceful use may be potential candidates for
treatment with NSAIDs; however, that population has not been studied in quality trials.
There is one high-quality study in post-operative patients indicating that for post-operative
pain management, naproxen is superior to acetaminophen, which in turn is superior to
placebo (Husby et al., 2001). NSAIDs and acetaminophen may also facilitate the
rehabilitation process without the impairments associated with opioids. Thus, NSAIDs and
acetaminophen are recommended for post-operative pain management.

ACETAMINOPHEN FOR POST-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF CTS-RELATED PAIN
Recommended
Acetaminophen is recommended for post-operative management of CTS-related pain.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Patients having recently undergone carpal tunnel surgical release. Generally treat 2 weeks
up to 6 weeks post-op unless complications occur.

Frequency/Dose/Duration
See manufacturer’s recommendations.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution of pain, adverse effects, intolerance.
Rationale
While NSAIDs have been widely used to attempt to address a theoretical inflammatory basis
for CTS and/or to treat pain associated with CTS, the one quality study comparing an NSAID
to placebo found no benefit from the NSAID (Chang et al., 1998). This same study also found
no difference between NSAIDs and diuretics which also appear ineffective. There is also no
quality evidence that there is a difference among NSAIDs (see Hip and Groin Disorders
Guideline). Thus, there is quality evidence that NSAIDs do not have a role in the treatment
of typical cases of CTS (Chang et al., 1998). Cases of CTS thought to have an inflammatory
component (e.g., inflammatory rheumatoid conditions) are reasonable exceptions where
NSAID and/or acetaminophen use may be appropriate. Other studies comparing NSAIDs
with manipulation plus ultrasound (Davis et al., 1998) and lidocaine patch (Nalamachu et al.,
2006) did not find benefits of NSAIDs compared with those treatments. A trial combining
splinting (which appears effective) plus NSAID versus glucocorticosteroid injection did not
find one arm to be superior (Celiker et al., 2002). While some patients may benefit from
NSAIDs, evidence is lacking that there is any beneficial effect of NSAIDs for treatment of CTS
and aggregate analyses of these studies also suggest NSAIDs are ineffective (Chang et al.,
1998, Davis et al., 1998, Nalamachu et al., 2006). Acetaminophen is thought to also be
ineffective. NSAIDs are not invasive and have low adverse effects profiles, particularly when
used for short courses in occupational populations. Generic or over-the-counter
formulations are low cost. However, there is quality evidence that other interventions are
effective. A short course of an over-the-counter NSAID may be reasonable for select
patients; however, routine use of NSAIDs for treatment of CTS is not recommended. Select
patients with acute CTS due to unaccustomed forceful use may be potential candidates for
treatment with NSAIDs; however, that population has not been studied in quality trials.
There is one high-quality study in post-operative patients indicating that for post-operative

GLUCOCORTICOSTEROIDS
Glucocorticosteroids are used to treat CTS and other tendinoses through both oral and
injection routes (injections for CTS and other tendinoses) (311,328-333). Although these
medications are considered to be anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, absent an
inflammatory arthropathy or infection, CTS does not typically evidence inflammation. Thus,
the exact mechanism of action is uncertain. Regardless, evidence indicates that carpal
tunnel injections are superior to oral steroids for treatment of CTS (333).
ORAL GLUCOCORTICOSTEROIDS FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC
CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
Recommended
Oral glucocorticosteroids are moderately recommended for treatment of acute, subacute,
or chronic CTS among patients who decline carpal tunnel injection.
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
CTS unresponsive to splinting. Most patients should be injected rather than given oral
steroids (Wong et al., 2001). However, for patients declining injection, oral
glucocorticosteroids may be warranted. Oral glucocorticosteroids are relatively
contraindicated for patients with diabetes mellitus and may worsen glucose intolerance
among those who are pregnant.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
It is unclear what dose and duration of treatment is optimal. Two trials used 10 days of
treatment with prednisolone acetate 25mg a day (Hui et al., 2001, Wong et al., 2001). A
third used prednisolone 20mg a day for 2 weeks, then 10mg a day for 2 weeks (Chang et al.,
1998, Mishra et al., 2006). Another used prednisone 20mg a day for 1 week, then 10mg a
day for 1 week (Herskovitz et al., 1995). Another used prednisolone 20mg a day for 2 weeks
on one treatment arm (Chang et al., 2002). There is evidence that 2 weeks of treatment is as
effective as 4 weeks (Chang et al., 2002). It is recommended that one course (10 to 14 days)

76

of oral glucocorticosteroid be prescribed rather than repeated courses. Prescriptions of low
rather than high doses are recommended to minimize potential for adverse effects.
Rationale
There is strong evidence that injected glucocorticosteroids are more effective (Wong et al.,
2001) with longer duration of benefits. Nevertheless, there is consistent evidence that oral
glucocorticosteroids are superior to placebo (Chang et al., 1998, Chang et al., 2002,
Herskovitz et al., 1995, Hui et al., 2004), as well as compared with diuretics and NSAIDs
(Chang et al., 1998). Unlike glucocorticosteroid injections, long-term follow-up studies have
not been reported, thus duration of benefit is unclear. However, oral glucocorticosteroids
are not invasive, have relatively few adverse effects for a short course, and are low cost.
Evidence
See Intracarpal Tunnel Glucocorticosteroid Injections (“Steroid Injections”) Section.

DIURETICS
Diuretics have been used to treat CTS, in part due to observations of swelling in some
patients (59,326,328,334-337).
DIURETICS FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC CTS
Not Recommended
Diuretics are moderately not recommended for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic
carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in the absence of fluid retention states.
Strength of evidence Moderately Not Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are two quality studies evaluating diuretics for treatment of CTS patients and both
failed to find evidence of efficacy compared with placebo (Chang et al., 1998, Pal et al.,
1988). Thus, diuretics are not recommended for routine treatment of CTS patients. Whether
they are effective for treatment of patients with CTS accompanied by fluid retention states,
such as third trimester pregnancy, has not been determined in quality studies, and thus
their use in select cases may be a reasonable intervention.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL and
Cochrane Library without date limits using the following terms: Diuretics,
Trichlormethiazide, Hydrochlorothiazide, carpal tunnel syndrome, CTS, median nerve
neuropathy, median neuropathy, median nerve disease, entrapment, neuropathy, nerve
compression, burning, itching, numbness, tingling, wrist, hand, palm, finger, pain, controlled

PubMed, 1556 in Scopus, 3 in CINAHL, 27 in Cochrane Library and 2 in other sources. We
considered for inclusion 2 from PubMed, 1 from Scopus, 0 from CINAHL, 1 from Cochrane
Library and 2 from other sources. Of the 6 articles considered for inclusion, 2 randomized
trials and 4 systematic studies met the inclusion criteria.

OPIOIDS
Opioids have occasionally been used to treat pain for patients with CTS. Opioids are
addressed in a separate Guideline. The treatment recommendations are summarized below.
See Opioids Guideline for all supporting evidence.
ROUTINE USE OF OPIOIDS FOR TREATMENT OF NON-SEVERE ACUTE PAIN
Not Recommended
Routine opioid use is strongly not recommended for treatment of non-severe acute pain
(e.g., low back pain (LBP), sprains, or minor injury without signs of tissue damage).
Strength of evidence Strongly Not Recommended, Evidence (A)
Level of confidence High
Benefits
Faster recovery, less debility, reduced accidents risks, risks of dependency or addiction.
Harms
May inadequately treat acute, severe pain.
Evidence
See Opioids Guideline.
OPIOIDS FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE, SEVERE PAIN
Recommended
Opioids are recommended for treatment of acute, severe pain (e.g., crush injuries, large
burns, severe fractures, injury with significant tissue damage) uncontrolled by other agents
and/or with functional deficits caused by pain. They also may be indicated at the initial visit
for a brief course for anticipated pain accompanying severe injuries (i.e., failure of other
treatment is not mandatory). A Schedule IV (Karl et al., 2015) opioid may be indicated if
there is true allergy to NSAIDs and acetaminophen, other contraindication to an alternative
medication, or insufficient pain relief with an alternative. Recommend to taper off opioid
use in 1 to 2 weeks.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence High

Indications
Patients should meet all of the following:
1) Severe injury with a clear rationale for use (objective functional limitations due to pain
resulting from the medical problem, e.g., extensive trauma such as forearm crush injury,
large burns, severe radiculopathy).
2) Other more efficacious treatments should have been instituted, and either: a) failed;
and/or b) have reasonable expectations of the immediate need for an opioid to obtain sleep
the evening after the injury.
3) Where available, prescription databases (usually referred to as Prescription Drug
Monitoring Program (PDMP)) should be checked and not show evidence for conflicting
opioid prescriptions from other clinicians or evidence of misreporting.
4) Non-opioid prescriptions (e.g., NSAIDs, acetaminophen) absent contraindication(s) should
nearly always be the primary treatment and accompany an opioid prescription.
5) Low-dose opioids may be needed in the elderly who have greater susceptibility to the
adverse risks of opioids. Those of lower body weight may also require lower opioid doses.
6) Dispensing quantities should be only what is needed to treat the pain. Short-acting
opioids are recommended for treatment of acute pain. Long-acting opioids are not
recommended.
7) Due to greater than 10-fold elevated risks of adverse effects and death, considerable
caution is warranted among those using other sedating medications and substances
including: i) benzodiazepines, ii) anti-histamines (H1-blockers), and/or iii) illicit substances
(Atluri et al., 2004, Cheng et al., 2013, Eriksen et al., 2006, Green et al., 2011). Patients
should not receive opioids if they use illicit substances unless there is objective evidence of
significant trauma or moderate to severe injuries. Considerable caution is also warranted
among those who are unemployed as the reported risks of death are also greater than 10fold (Cheng et al., 2013, Eriksen et al., 2006). Due to elevated risk of death and adverse
effects, caution is also warranted when considering prescribing an opioid for patients with
any of the following characteristics: depression, anxiety, personality disorder, untreated
sleep disorders, substance abuse history, current alcohol use or current tobacco use,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
suicidal risk, impulse control problems, thought disorders, psychotropic medication use,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or recurrent pneumonia (Cheng et
al., 2013, Dunn et al., 2010, Grattan et al., 2012, Hadidi et al., 2009, Hall et al., 2008,
Manchikanti et al., 2004, Nyhlen et al., 2011, Paulozzi et al., 2012, Paulozzi et al., 2009, Shah
et al., 2008, Toblin et al., 2010, Webster et al., 2011, Wunsch et al., 2009, Wysowski, 2007,

Goodridge et al., 2010, Mills et al., 2005, Seal et al., 2012). Considerable caution is also
warranted among those with other comorbidities such as chronic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis

(Walter et al., 2011), as well as coronary artery disease, dysrhythmias, cerebrovascular
disease, orthostatic hypotension, asthma, recurrent pneumonia, thermoregulatory
problems, advanced age (especially with mentation issues, fall risk, debility), osteopenia,
osteoporosis, water retention, renal failure, severe obesity, testosterone deficiency, erectile
dysfunction, abdominal pain, gastroparesis, constipation, prostatic hypertrophy,
oligomenorrhea, pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), ineffective birth control,
herpes, allodynia, dementia, cognitive dysfunction and impairment, gait problems, tremor,
concentration problems, insomnia, coordination problems, and slow reaction time. There
are considerable drug-drug interactions that have been reported (see Appendices 2-3 of
Opioids Guideline).
Benefits
Improved short-term pain control.
Harms
Adverse effects are many (see section on “Opioids Benefits and Harms”).
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Generally, opioids should be prescribed at night or while not working (Gomes et al., 2013).
Lowest effective, short-acting opioid doses are preferable as they tend to have the better
safety profiles, less risk of escalation (Cifuentes et al., 2010), less risk of lost time from work
(Volinn et al., 2009), and faster return to work (Dersh et al., 2008). Short-acting opioids are
recommended for treatment of acute pain and long-acting opioids are not recommended.
Recommend opioid use as required by pain, rather than in regularly scheduled dosing.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution of pain, sufficient improvement in pain, intolerance or adverse effects, noncompliance, surreptitious medication use, consumption of medications or substances
advised to not take concomitantly (e.g., sedating medications, alcohol, benzodiazepines), or
use beyond 2 weeks.
Evidence
See Opioids Guideline.
SCREENING PATIENTS PRIOR TO INITIATION OF OPIOIDS
Recommended
Initial screening of patients is recommended with more detailed screening for: i) requiring
continuation of opioids beyond 2 weeks for those with an acute severe injury, and ii) at
consideration of initiation for severe pain but no objective evidence. Screening should
include history(ies) of depression, anxiety, personality disorder, other psychiatric disorder,
substance abuse, sedating medication use (e.g., anti-histamine/anti-H1 blocker (Cheng et

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

al., 2013)), benzodiazepine use, opioid dependence, alcohol abuse, current tobacco use,
other substance use history, COPD, PTSD, other psychotropic medications, (severe) obesity,
cognitive impairment, balance problems/fall risk, osteoporosis, and renal failure (see
Appendix 1 of Opioids Guideline). Those who screen positive, especially to multiple criteria,
are recommended to: i) undergo greater scrutiny for appropriateness of opioids (may
include psychological evaluation), ii) consideration of consultation and examination(s) for
complicating conditions and/or appropriateness of opioids, and iii) if opioids are prescribed,
more frequent assessments for compliance, achievement of functional gains (Eriksen et al.,
2006, Reneman et al., 2002, Swinkels-Meewisse et al., 2006), adverse effects, and
symptoms and signs of aberrancy.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Benefits
Improved identification of more appropriate candidates for opioids. Identification of
patients at increased risk of adverse effects. In cases where someone has elevated, but
potentially acceptable risk, may alert the clinician to improve surveillance for complications
and aberrant behaviors.
Harms
Negligible. If a consultation is needed, there are additional costs that are incurred.
Evidence
See Opioids Guideline.
OPIOID DOSE LIMITS IN ACUTE PAIN
Recommended
Dispense only that which is required. The maximum daily oral dose recommended for
opioid-naïve, acute pain patients based on risk of overdose/death is 50mg morphine
equivalent dose (MED) (Bohnert et al., 2011) (see Figure 4). In rare cases with documented
functional improvement (see Appendix 1 of Opioids Guideline), higher doses may be
considered, however, risks are substantially higher and greater monitoring is also
recommended (see Subacute/Chronic Opioid recommendations below). Lower doses should
be used for patients at higher risk of dependency, addiction and other adverse effects.
Monitoring is also recommended and consultation may be considered for those patients on
higher doses.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Moderate
Benefits

Reduced risk for adverse physical and cognitive effects, dependency, addiction and opioidrelated overdoses and deaths.
Harms
Theoretical potential to undertreat pain in some patients with increased pain sensitivity.
Evidence
See Opioids Guideline.
LIMITED USE OF OPIOIDS FOR POST-OPERATIVE PAIN
Recommended
Limited use of opioids is recommended for post-operative pain management as adjunctive
therapy to more effective treatments.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence High
Indications
For post-operative pain management, a brief prescription of short-acting opioids as adjunct
to more efficacious treatments (especially Cox-2 NSAIDs such as celecoxib, non-selective
NSAIDs after risk of bleeding is no longer a concern) (Karl et al., 2015). A brief course of
opioids is often needed for minor surgical procedures. However, minor wound laceration
repairs often require no opioids. Evidence suggests perioperative pregabalin for 14 days
and/or continuous femoral nerve catheter analgesia instead of solely using oral opioids
results in superior knee arthroplasty functional outcomes with less venous thromboses
(Nader et al., 2012). Additional considerations include:
1. Non-opioid prescriptions (e.g., NSAIDs, acetaminophen) should nearly always be the
primary treatment and accompany an opioid prescription. Computerized programs may also
assist in optimal management (Belknap et al., 2008).
2. The lowest effective dose of a short-acting opioid should be used (Cifuentes et al., 2010),
as well as weaker opioids if possible (Volinn et al., 2009, Dersh et al., 2008).
3. Short-acting opioids are recommended for treatment of acute pain.
4. Dispensing should be only what is needed to treat the pain (U. S. Department of Labor et
al., 2013).
5. Long-acting opioids are not recommended.
6. Low-dose opioids may be needed in the elderly who have greater susceptibility to the
adverse risks of opioids. Those of lower body weight may also require lower opioid doses.

7. Where available, prescription databases (usually referred to as Prescription Drug
Monitoring Program (PDMP)) should be checked for other opioid prescriptions. Due to
greater than 10-fold elevated risks of adverse effects and death, considerable caution is
warranted among those using other sedating medications and substances including: i)
benzodiazepines, ii) anti-histamines (H1-blockers), and/or iii) illicit substances (Atluri et al.,
2004, Cheng et al., 2013, Eriksen et al., 2006, Green et al., 2011). Patients should not receive
opioids if they use illicit substances unless there is objective evidence of significant trauma
or moderate to severe injuries. Considerable caution is also warranted among those who
are unemployed as the reported risks of death are also greater than 10-fold (Cheng et al.,
2013, Eriksen et al., 2006).
Due to elevated risk of death and adverse effects, caution is also warranted when
considering prescribing an opioid for patients with any of the following characteristics:
depression, anxiety, personality disorder, ADHD, PTSD, suicidal risk, impulse control
problems, thought disorders, psychotropic medication use, substance abuse history, current
alcohol use or current tobacco use, untreated sleep disorders, COPD, asthma, or recurrent
pneumonia (Cheng et al., 2013, Dunn et al., 2010, Grattan et al., 2012). Considerable caution
is also warranted among those with other comorbidities such as chronic hepatitis and/or
cirrhosis (Walter et al., 2011), as well as coronary artery disease, dysrhythmias,
cerebrovascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, thermoregulatory problems, advanced
age (especially with mentation issues, fall risk, debility), osteopenia, osteoporosis, water
retention, renal failure, severe obesity, testosterone deficiency, erectile dysfunction,
abdominal pain, gastroparesis, constipation, prostatic hypertrophy, oligomenorrhea,
pregnancy, HIV, ineffective birth control, herpes, allodynia, dementia, cognitive dysfunction
and impairment, gait problems, tremor, concentration problems, insomnia, coordination
problems, and slow reaction time. There are considerable drug-drug interactions that have
been reported (see Appendices 2-3 of Opioids Guideline). Inpatient management may
moderate these recommendations provided there is careful monitoring, although these
same management issues then apply post-discharge.
8. For patients taking opioids chronically prior to surgery, consultations with anesthesiology
and/or pain management are generally needed as post-operative dosing may be very high
and management is often quite challenging.
9. Ongoing prescriptions of opioids after the immediate post-operative period should
generally be for patients who have undergone a major surgery or have other condition(s)
necessitating opioids. Most patients should be making progress towards functional
restoration, pain reduction and weaning off the opioids. Patients who have not progressed
should be carefully evaluated for physical complications or psychiatric comorbidity,
adherence to active treatments, and pending development of addiction or dependency.
Benefits
Improved short-term, post-operative pain control. Some studies suggest this may modestly
improve functional outcomes in the post-operative population.

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

83

Harms
Adverse effects are many (see section on “Opioids Benefits and Harms”).
Frequency/Dose/Duration
For moderate and major surgeries, opioids are generally needed on a scheduled basis in the
immediate post-operative period. Other post-operative situations may be sufficiently
managed with an as needed opioid prescription schedule. Provision of opioids sufficient to
participate in therapeutic exercise (e.g., progressive ambulation) and allow sleep may be
needed. However, high dose use at night is not recommended due to respiratory depression
and disruption of sleep architecture. Weaning should begin as soon as function is recovering
and pain is subsiding. Subsequent weaning to as needed opioid use is recommended.
Indications for discontinuation
The physician should discontinue the use of opioids based on sufficient recovery, expected
resolution of pain, lack of efficacy, intolerance or adverse effects, non-compliance,
surreptitious medication use, self-escalation of dose, or use beyond 3 to 5 days for minor
procedures, and 2 to 3 weeks for moderate/less extensive procedures. Use for up to 3
months may occasionally be necessary during recovery from more extensive surgical
procedures (e.g., spine fusion surgery). However, with rare exceptions, only nocturnal use is
recommended in months 2 to 3 plus institution of management as discussed in the
subacute/chronic guidelines below. For those requiring opioid use beyond 1 month, the
subacute/chronic opioid use recommendations below apply.
Evidence
See Opioids Guideline.
SCREENING PATIENTS PRIOR TO CONTINUATION OF OPIOIDS
Recommended
Screening of patients is recommended for patients requiring continuation of opioids beyond
the second post-operative week.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Benefits
Identification of patients at increased risk of adverse effects. Improved identification of
more appropriate and safe candidates for opioids compared with attempting post-operative
pain control with non-opioids. This should reduce adverse effects. In cases where someone
has elevated, but potentially acceptable risk, this may alert the clinician to improve
surveillance for complications and aberrant behaviors.

Harms
Negligible. If a consultation is needed, there are additional costs that are incurred
Rationale
Screening should include history(ies) of: depression, anxiety, personality disorder, pain
disorder, other psychiatric disorder, substance abuse history, sedating medication use (e.g.,
anti-histamine/anti-H1 blocker), benzodiazepine use, opioid dependence, alcohol abuse,
current tobacco use, and other substance use history, COPD, PTSD, other psychotropic
medications, (severe) obesity, cognitive impairment, balance problems/fall risk,
osteoporosis, and renal failure (see Appendix 1 of Opioids Guideline). Those who screen
positive, especially to multiple criteria, are recommended to: i) undergo greater scrutiny for
appropriateness of opioids (e.g., may include psychological and/or pain evaluation); ii)
compliance with active therapies (e.g., ambulation and other exercise after arthroplasty); iii)
consider consultation examination(s) for complicating conditions and/or appropriateness of
opioids; and iv) if ongoing opioids are prescribed, ensure more frequent assessments for
treatment compliance, achievement of functional gains (Eriksen et al., 2006, Reneman et al.,
2002, Swinkels-Meewisse et al., 2006), and symptoms and signs of aberrancy.
Evidence
See Opioids Guideline.
OPIOID DOSE LIMITS IN POST-OPERATIVE PAIN
Recommended
The maximum daily oral dose recommended for opioid-naïve, acute pain patients based on
risk of overdose/death is 50mg morphine equivalent dose (MED) (Shanahan et al., 2006,
Bohnert et al., 2011) (see Figure 4). Post-operative patients particularly require
individualization due to factors such as the severity of the operative procedure, response to
treatment(s) and variability in response. Higher doses beyond 50mg MED may be
particularly needed for major surgeries in the first two post-operative weeks to achieve
sufficient pain relief, however, greater caution and monitoring are warranted and
reductions below 50mg MED at the earliest opportunity should be sought. Lower doses
should be used for patients at higher risk of dependency, addiction and other adverse
effects. In rare cases with documented functional improvement, ongoing use of higher
doses may be considered, however, risks are substantially higher and greater monitoring is
also recommended (see Subacute/Chronic Opioid recommendations below).
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Benefits
Reduced risk for adverse effects, dependency, addiction and opioid-related deaths.

Harms
Theoretical potential to undertreat pain, which could modestly delay functional recovery.
Evidence
See Opioids Guideline.
ROUTINE USE OF OPIOIDS FOR SUBACUTE AND CHRONIC NON-MALIGNANT PAIN
Not Recommended
Opioid use is moderately not recommended for treatment of subacute and chronic nonmalignant pain. Opioid prescription should be patient specific and limited to cases in which
other treatments are insufficient and criteria for opioid use are met (see below).
Strength of evidence Moderately Not Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence High
Benefits
Less debility, fewer adverse effects, reduced accident risks, lower risks of dependency,
addiction, overdoses, and deaths.
Harms
May inadequately treat severe subacute or chronic pain.
Evidence
See Opioids Guideline.
OPIOIDS FOR TREATMENT OF SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC SEVERE PAIN
Recommended
The use of an opioid trial is recommended if other evidence-based approaches for
functional restorative pain therapy have been used with inadequate improvement in
function (Federation of State Medical Boards, 2013, International Association of Industrial
Accident Boards and Commissions, 2013). Opioids are then recommended for treatment of
function impaired by subacute or chronic severe pain (e.g., inability to work due to any of
the following: chronic severe radiculopathy, chronic severe peripheral neuropathies,
complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and severe arthroses) (Reneman et al., 2002) (see
Opioids Guideline).

Indications
Patients should meet all of the following:
1. Reduced function is attributable to the pain. Pain or pain scales alone are insufficient
reasons (Eriksen et al., 2006, Reneman et al., 2002, Brouwer et al., 2005, Buelow et al.,
2009, Food and Drug Administration, 2013, Fox et al., 1979, Gross et al., 2003, Hartrick et
al., 2003, Lund et al., 2005, Mahowald et al., 2005, Morasco et al., 2013, Reneman et al.,
2007, Schiphorst Preuper et al., 2008, Smeets et al., 2007).
2. A severe disorder warranting potential opioid treatment is present [e.g., CRPS, severe
radiculopathy, advanced degenerative joint disease (DJD)] (Food and Drug Administration,
2013).
3. Other more efficacious treatments have been documented to have failed (Food and Drug
Administration, 2013). Other approaches that should have been first utilized include
physical restorative approaches, behavioral interventions, self-applied modalities, nonopioid medications (including NSAIDs, acetaminophen, topical agents, norepinephrine
adrenergic reuptake blocking antidepressants or dual reuptake inhibitors; also antiepileptic
medications particularly for neuropathic pain) and functional restoration. For LBP patients,
this also includes fear avoidant belief training and ongoing progressive aerobic exercise, and
strengthening exercises. For CRPS patients, this includes progressive strengthening exercise.
For DJD, this includes NSAIDs, weight loss, aerobic and strengthening exercises.
4. An ongoing active exercise program is prescribed and complied with.
5. Non-opioid prescriptions (e.g., NSAIDs, acetaminophen) absent a contraindication should
nearly always be the primary pain medication and accompany an opioid prescription. Other
medications to consider include topical agents, norepinephrine adrenergic reuptake
blocking antidepressants or dual reuptake inhibitors; also antiepileptic medications
particularly for neuropathic pain).
6. The lowest effective dose should be used (Cifuentes et al., 2010). Weaker opioids should
be used whenever possible (Volinn et al., 2009, Dersh et al., 2008). Meperidine is not
recommended for chronic pain due to bioaccumulation and adverse effects.
7. Low-dose opioids may be needed in the elderly who have greater susceptibility to the
adverse risks of opioids. Those of lower body weight may also require lower opioid doses.
8. Dispensing should be only what is needed to treat the pain (Wilson d'Almeida et al.,
2008).
9. Extended-release/long-acting opioids are recommended to be used on a scheduled basis,
rather than as needed (Food and Drug Administration, 2013). As needed opioids should
generally be avoided for treatment of chronic pain, although limited use for an acute painful
event (e.g., fracture, sprain) is reasonable. Sublingual fentanyl is not recommended for

87

treatment of subacute or chronic pain. Caution is warranted with fentanyl patches due to
unpredictable absorption.
10. Where available, prescription databases (usually referred to as Prescription Drug
Monitoring Program (PDMP)) should be checked for conflicting opioid prescriptions from
other clinicians or evidence of misreporting.
11. Due to greater than 10-fold elevated risks of adverse effects and death, considerable
caution is warranted among those using other sedating medications and substances
including: i) benzodiazepines, ii) anti-histamines (H1-blockers), and/or iii) illicit substances
(Atluri et al., 2004, Cheng et al., 2013, Eriksen et al., 2006, Green et al., 2011). Patients
should not receive opioids if they use illicit substances unless there is objective evidence of
significant trauma or moderate to severe injuries. Considerable caution is also warranted
among those who are unemployed as the reported risks of death are also greater than 10fold (Cheng et al., 2013, Green et al., 2011).
Due to elevated risk of death and adverse effects, caution is also warranted when
considering prescribing an opioid for patients with any of the following characteristics:
depression, anxiety, personality disorder, untreated sleep disorders, substance abuse
history, current alcohol use or current tobacco use, ADHD, PTSD, suicidal risk, impulse
control problems, thought disorders, psychotropic medication use, COPD, asthma, recurrent
pneumonia (Cheng et al., 2013, Dunn et al., 2010, Grattan et al., 2012, Hadidi et al., 2009,
Hall et al., 2008, Manchikanti et al., 2004, Nyhlen et al., 2011, Paulozzi et al., 2012, Paulozzi
et al., 2009, Shah et al., 2008, Toblin et al., 2010, Webster et al., 2011, Wunsch et al., 2009,
Wysowski, 2007, Wysowski et al., 2006, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010, Dean, 2004, Deyo et al., 2011, Fareed et
al., 2009, Goodridge et al., 2010, Mills et al., 2005, Seal et al., 2012). Considerable caution is
also warranted among those with other comorbidities such as chronic hepatitis and/or
cirrhosis (Walter et al., 2011), as well as coronary artery disease, dysrhythmias,
cerebrovascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, asthma, recurrent pneumonia,
thermoregulatory problems, advanced age (especially with mentation issues, fall risk,
debility), osteopenia, osteoporosis, water retention, renal failure, severe obesity,
testosterone deficiency, erectile dysfunction, abdominal pain, gastroparesis, constipation,
prostatic hypertrophy, oligomenorrhea, pregnancy, HIV, ineffective birth control, herpes,
allodynia, dementia, cognitive dysfunction and impairment, gait problems, tremor,
concentration problems, insomnia, coordination problems, and slow reaction time. There
are considerable drug-drug interactions that have been reported (see Appendices 2-3 of
Opioids Guideline).
Benefits
Improved short-term pain ratings. Theoretical potential to improve short-term function
impaired by a painful condition.

88

Harms
Adverse effects are many (see section on “Opioids Benefits and Harms”). May initiate path
to opioid dependency.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Opioids use is generally initiated as a “trial” to ascertain whether the selected opioid
produces functional improvement (see Appendix 1 of Opioids Guideline). Opioid use is
generally prescribed on a regular basis (Von Korff et al., 2011), at night or when not at work
(Gomes et al., 2013). Only one opioid is recommended to be prescribed in a trial. More than
one opioid should rarely be used. Lower opioid doses are preferable as they tend to have
the better safety profiles, less risk of dose escalation (Cifuentes et al., 2010), less work loss
(Volinn et al., 2009), and faster return to work (Dersh et al., 2008). Patients should have
ongoing visits to monitor efficacy, adverse effects, compliance and surreptitious medication
use. Opioid prescriptions should be shorter rather than longer duration (Cifuentes et al.,
2012).
Indications for discontinuation
Opioids should be discontinued based on lack of functional benefit (International
Association of Industrial Accident Boards and Commissions, 2013) (see Appendix 1 of
Opioids Guideline), resolution of pain, improvement to the point of not requiring opioids,
intolerance or adverse effects, non-compliance, surreptitious medication use, medication
misuse (including self-escalation and sharing medication), aberrant drug screening results,
diversion, consumption of medications or substances advised to not take concomitantly
(e.g., sedating medications, alcohol, benzodiazepines).
Evidence
See Opioids Guideline.
SCREENING PATIENTS PRIOR TO INITIATION OF OPIOIDS
Recommended
Screening of patients is recommended prior to consideration of initiating a trial of opioids
for treatment of subacute or chronic pain. Screening should include history(ies) of
depression, anxiety, personality disorder and personality profile (Dersh et al., 2008, Hartrick
et al., 2012, Hartrick et al., 2003), other psychiatric disorder, substance abuse history,
sedating medication use (e.g., anti-histamine/anti-H1 blocker) (Webster et al., 2011),
benzodiazepine use, opioid dependence, alcohol abuse, current tobacco use, and other
substance use history, COPD, PTSD, other psychotropic medications, (severe) obesity,
cognitive impairment, balance problems/fall risk, osteoporosis, and renal failure (see
Appendix 1 of Opioids Guideline). Those who screen positive, especially to multiple criteria,
are recommended to: i) undergo greater scrutiny for appropriateness of opioids (may
include psychological and/or psychiatric evaluation(s) to help assure opioids are not being
used instead of appropriate mental health care); ii) consideration of consultation and

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

89

examination(s) for complicating conditions and/or appropriateness of opioids; and iii) if
opioids are prescribed, more frequent assessments for compliance, achievement of
functional gains and symptoms and signs of aberrant use.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Benefits
Identification of patients at increased risk of adverse effects. Improved identification of
more appropriate and safe candidates for treatment with opioids. This should reduce
adverse effects. In cases where someone has elevated, but potentially acceptable risk, this
may alert the clinician to improve surveillance for complications and aberrant behaviors.
Harms
Negligible. If a consultation is needed, there are additional costs that are incurred.
Evidence
See Opioids Guideline.
OPIOID DOSE LIMITS IN SUBACUTE AND CHRONIC PAIN
Recommended
The maximum daily oral dose recommended for subacute or chronic pain patients based on
risk of overdose/death is 50mg Morphine Equivalent Dose (MED) (Dunn et al., 2010,
Bohnert et al., 2011). In rare cases with documented functional improvements occurring
with use above 50mg MED, subsequent doses up to 100mg may be considered; however,
risks of death are much greater and more intensive monitoring is then also recommended.
Lower doses should be considered in high-risk patients. Caution appears warranted in all
patients as there is evidence the risk of dose escalation is present even among patients
enrolled in a “hold the line (stable dose) prescribing strategy” treatment arm (Naliboff et al.,
2011).
For those whose daily consumption is more than 50mg MED, greater monitoring is
recommended to include: i) at least monthly to not more than quarterly appointments with
greater frequencies during trial, dose adjustments and with greater co-morbid risk factors
and conditions; ii) at least semiannual attempts to wean below 50mg MED if not off the
opioid; iii) at least semiannual documentation of persistence of functional benefit; iv) at
least quarterly urine drug screening (see drug screening section); and v) at least semiannual
review of medications, particularly to assure no sedating medication use (e.g.,
benzodiazepine, sedating anti-histamines).

Benefits
Reduced risk for adverse effects, dependency, addiction, and opioid-related deaths.
Harms
None in a short-term trial. For chronic pain patients, theoretical potential to undertreat pain
and thus impair function. However, there is no quality literature currently available to
support that position.
Evidence
See Opioids Guideline.
USE OF AN OPIOID TREATMENT AGREEMENT (OPIOID CONTRACT, DOCTOR/PATIENT
AGREEMENT, INFORMED CONSENT)
Recommended
The use of an opioid treatment agreement (opioid contract, doctor/patient agreement, or
informed consent) is recommended to document patient understanding, acknowledgement
of potential adverse effects, and agreement with the expectations of opioid use (see
Appendix 1 of Opioids Guideline) (Federation of State Medical Boards, 2013, Chou et al.,
2009, Goldberg et al., 2005, Manchikanti et al., 2006, Manchikanti et al., 2006, Starrels et
al., 2010, Wiedemer et al., 2007, Chelminski et al., 2005, Compton et al., 2008, Hariharan et
al., 2007, Ives et al., 2006, Vaglienti et al., 2003, Burchman et al., 1995). If consent obtained,
it is recommended appropriate family members be involved in this agreement.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Benefits
Educates the patient and significant others that these medications are high risk, with
numerous adverse effects. It allows for a more informed choice. It provides a framework for
initiation of a trial, monitoring, treatment goals, compliance requirement, treatment
expectations, and conditions for opioid cessation. It should reduce risk of adverse events
and opioid-related deaths, although that remains unproven to date.
Harms
Negligible

URINE DRUG SCREENING FOR PATIENTS PRESCRIBED OPIOIDS
Recommended
Baseline and random urine drug screening, qualitative and quantitative, is recommended for
patients prescribed opioids for the treatment of subacute or chronic pain to evaluate
presence or absence of the drug, its metabolites, and other substance(s) use. In certain
situations, other screenings (e.g., hair particularly for information regarding remote use
(Appenzeller et al., 2007, Cooper et al., 2012, Kulaga et al., 2009, Lamoureux et al., 2009,
Lees et al., 2012, Politi et al., 2007) or blood (for acute toxicity) may be appropriate.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence High
Indications
All patients on opioids for subacute or chronic pain.
Benefits
Identifies aberrant medication(s) and substance(s) use. Such uses are high-risk for opioid
events including fatalities (see tables below). It provides objective evidence to cease an
opioid trial or ongoing treatment. Identifies patients who may be diverting medication
(those screening negative for prescribed medication).
Harms
No adverse clinical effects if properly interpreted.
Rationale
Screening is recommended at baseline, randomly at least twice, and up to 4 times a year
and at termination. More intensive screening is recommended for those consuming more
than 50mg MED (see above). Federal guidelines recommend at least 8 tests a year among
those utilizing opioid treatment programs . Screening should also be performed “for cause”
(e.g., clinician suspicion of substance misuse including over-sedating, drug intoxication,
motor vehicle crash, other accidents and injuries, driving while intoxicated, premature
prescription renewals, self-directed dose changes, lost or stolen prescriptions, using more
than one clinician for prescriptions, non-pain use of medication, using alcohol for pain
treatment or excessive alcohol use, missed appointments, hoarding of medications, and
selling medications). Standard urine drug/toxicology screening processes should be followed
(consult a qualified medical review officer). (740-742) If there is an aberrant drug screen
result (either positive for unexpected drugs or unexpected metabolites or unexpectedly
negative results), there should be a careful evaluation of whether there is a plausible
explanation (e.g., drug not tested, drug metabolite not tested, laboratory cutpoint and
dosing interval would not capture the drug/metabolite, laboratory error). In the absence of
a plausible explanation, those patients with aberrant test results should have the opioid
discontinued or weaned .

VITAMINS
Treatment of CTS with pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) has been attempted (326,335,338,339,340,341) as
there has been some association between pyridoxine deficiencies and peripheral
neuropathies, as well as some reports of associations of deficiencies with CTS in some (342),
but not all studies (343). Vitamin B12 has also been reported as a successful treatment for
stroke patients with CTS (344).
PYRIDOXINE FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC CTS
Not Recommended
Pyridoxine is not recommended for routine treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS in
patients without vitamin deficiencies.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are two quality studies that reviewed pyridoxine to treat CTS patients. However,
benefits have not been shown in the highest quality study (Spooner et al., 1993). The
moderate-quality crossover trial reported improvements in symptoms in 7 patients;
however, 3 patients did not receive the placebo although their symptoms scores on
pyridoxine were lower than in a control period (Ellis et al., 1982). While vitamin B-6 is
relatively low risk and patients may use it without prescription, available evidence does not
support its use for the routine treatment of CTS, thus it is not recommended. However, it
may be a reasonable treatment option among patients with presumptive pyridoxine
deficiency (e.g., malnutrition, alcoholism, malabsorption, especially jejunal disorders such as
sprue, etc.).

TOPICAL MEDICATIONS
Topical lidocaine patches have been increasingly used to treat numerous pain conditions
through transdermal application of topical anesthetic (345-347).
LIDOCAINE PATCHES FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC CTS
Recommended
Lidocaine patches are recommended for treatment of select cases of acute, subacute, or
chronic CTS with pain.

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

94

Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Moderate to severe CTS with pain as a central complaint when other treatable causes of the
pain have been eliminated and after more efficacious treatment strategies, such as splinting
and glucocorticosteroid injection(s), have been attempted.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Usually 3 patches per day. Duration of use for chronic, localized pain may be as long as
indefinitely, although most patients do not require indefinite treatment, as symptoms
usually resolve, improve, or require surgery. Caution is warranted regarding widespread use
of topical anesthetics for potential systemic effects from widespread administration (US
Food and Drug Administration, 2009). For the hand this may require both patches and other
applications or use in other body locations.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution, intolerance, adverse effects, lack of benefits, or failure to progress over a trial of
at least 2 weeks.
Rationale
Topical lidocaine has been suggested to improve pain associated with CTS although the case
diagnoses do not appear well substantiated in the available study as pain complaints as an
overriding symptom among CTS patients raise concerns about alternate explanations for the
symptoms (Nalamachu et al., 2006). In one moderate-quality study, lidocaine patches were
suggested to be somewhat more effective than naproxen (Nalamachu et al., 2006);
however, naproxen does not appear particularly effective and the study had a number of
weaknesses. In the other study, injection was comparable to the patch, yet injections are
likely a more effective strategy than naproxen, thus this body of evidence somewhat
conflicts. Lidocaine patches are not invasive and have low adverse effects although some
patients may experience local reactions such as skin irritation, redness, pain, or sores. These
patches are also moderately or even high cost over time. While there are other lower cost
topical treatments that provide analgesia (including heat, ice, and capsaicin), lidocaine
patches may be a reasonable treatment option for pain related to CTS. Patients should be
monitored to ensure that they are receiving benefit and to ascertain if there are any
untoward local skin changes as a result of use.

abuse and without a recognized medical use (e.g., heroin, marijuana, LSD). Class II includes most opiates,
amphetamines and cocaine. Class III includes buprenorphine, dihydrocodeiene, hydrocodone/codeine when
compounded with an NSAID, Marinol. Class IV includes tramadol (in some states), carisoprodol,
benzodiazepines, and long-activating barbiturates. Class V includes small amounts of codeine (e.g, 30, 60mg).
[2] Other indications beyond the scope of this guideline include acute myocardial infarction or agitation
interfering with acute trauma management.
[3] Treatments to have tried generally include NSAIDs and acetaminophen. For LBP patients, additional
considerations include muscle relaxants, progressive aerobic exercise, and directional exercise.
[4]

Exceptions such as acute, severe trauma should be documented.

[5] Statistical significance present for acute and chronic pain at and above 50 mg per day of oral morphine
equivalent dose.
[6] More efficacious treatments also include therapeutic exercises, e.g., progressive ambulation especially
for moderate to extensive procedures (e.g., arthroplasty, fusion).
[7] Generally, this should be sufficient to cover two weeks of treatment. Prescriptions of 90-day supplies in
the post-operative setting are not recommended.
[8] Statistical significance present for acute and chronic pain at and above 50 mg per day of morphine
equivalent dose.
[9] A previous trial of a muscle relaxant is generally recommended. However, if an opioid trial is
contemplated, cessation of all depressant medications including muscle relaxants is advisable.
[10] Generally, this should be sufficient to cover one week of treatment at a time during the trial phase. If a
trial is successful at improving function, prescriptions for up to 90-day supplies are recommended.

ALLIED HEALTH THERAPIES
ACUPUNCTURE
Acupuncture has been used to treat CTS and other hand, wrist, and forearm MSDs (349,350).
There is evidence of its efficacy for treatment of chronic spine disorders, although the
evidence suggests traditional acupuncture is not superior to other acupuncture methods
(see Chronic Pain and Low Back Disorders Guidelines).
ACUPUNCTURE FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC CTS
Not Recommended
Acupuncture is not recommended for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are quality trials of acupuncture compared with placebo or sham acupuncture and
they have failed to show benefit of acupuncture for treatment of CTS (Yao et al., 2012). One
trial found no differences between acupuncture and oral steroid (Yang et al., 2009, Yang et
al., 2011). Another trial susceptible to contact time bias found minimal differences between
acupuncture and nocturnal wrist splinting (Kumnerddee et al., 2010). Thus, the highest
quality evidence suggests acupuncture is ineffective for treatment of CTS and acupuncture
is not recommended.

BIOFEEDBACK
Biofeedback is a behavioral medicine method of providing automated information and
training to improve control of certain physiologic processes which are normally inaccessible
to a subject’s perception. Audible electromyographic (EMB) biofeedback has been used to
treat CTS (351).
BIOFEEDBACK FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC CTS
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of biofeedback for treatment of acute,
subacute, or chronic CTS.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)

LOW-LEVEL LASER THERAPY
Low-level laser treatment (LLLT) has been used to treat MSDs including CTS (349,352,353). It
usually involves laser energy that does not induce significant heating (the theory is that the
mechanism of action is through photoactivation of the oxidative chain) (354).

Not Recommended
Low level laser therapy is not recommended for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic
CTS.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are multiple moderate-quality studies evaluating LLLT with all of the higher quality
studies demonstrating lack of efficacy. There are 5 trials comparing LLLT with sham/placebo
laser and the 3 highest quality studies found lack of benefit (Evcik et al., 2007, Irvine et al.,
2004, Tascioglu et al., 2012). One trial found no differences when compared with ultrasound
(Bakhtiary et al., 2004) and a second trial found ultrasound superior (Saeed et al., 2012).
Another study found no additive benefits of LLLT over splinting (Yagci et al., 2009). Thus,
higher quality evidence indicates LLLT is not effective for treatment of CTS. Low-level laser
therapy is not invasive, has low adverse effects, but is costly. It is not recommended for the
treatment of CTS.

MAGNETIC THERAPY
Treatment of CTS and other hand, wrist, and forearm MSDs with magnets (355-357) and pulsed
magnetic field therapy (358-360) has been attempted to manage pain (300,312,336).
MAGNETS FOR MANAGEMENT OF PAIN FROM OF ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC
CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
Not Recommended
Magnets are moderately not recommended for management of pain from acute, subacute,
or chronic carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).
Strength of evidence Moderately Not Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence High
Rationale
Quality evidence suggests magnets (Carter et al., 2002, Colbert et al., 2010) are ineffective
for treatment of CTS. Low-quality evidence suggests pulsed magnetic field therapy
(Dakowicz et al., 2011, Arikan, 2011) is not effective for treating CTS (Carter et al., 2002).
Magnets are not invasive, have no adverse effects, and are low cost, but other interventions
have been shown effective. Thus, magnets are not recommended for treatment of CTS.

MANIPULATION AND MOBILIZATION
Manipulation and mobilization are two types of manual therapy which have been used for
treatment of CTS (301,361-367). These include wide arrays of different techniques and schools of
thought. Some consider these two interventions to be on a spectrum of velocity and applied
force. In general, mobilization involves assisted, low-force, low-velocity movement.
Manipulation involves high-force, high-velocity, and low-amplitude action with a focus on
moving a target joint (see Chronic Pain and Low Back Disorders Guidelines for more details).
MANIPULATION OF THE WRIST ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC CTS
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of manipulation of the wrist for
treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are two moderate-quality studies that evaluate manipulation for treatment of CTS.
However, both have considerable methodological problems. One study compared
manipulation plus ultrasound versus ibuprofen. Exclusion criteria did not exclude prior
ibuprofen use, which is may well have been widespread, resulting in a comparison
analogous to no treatment, which biases towards the other treatment arm, ibuprofen use

manipulation plus ultrasound. That study failed to find improvements compared with
ibuprofen (Davis et al., 1998) which as noted previously appear ineffective. The other
moderate-quality study had two active-treatment arms (Burke et al., 2007). Thus, there is
no quality study showing manipulation is effective as a treatment for CTS. Manipulation is
not invasive, is moderately costly, but does have rare adverse effects from cervical
manipulation. Cervical manipulation is not recommended for treatment of CTS. There is no
recommendation for or against manipulation of the wrist as there is an absence of quality
evidence.

MASSAGE AND THERAPEUTIC TOUCH
Massage has been used to treat patients with CTS, particularly when combined with other
forearm symptoms (61). Therapeutic touch, considered an alternative healing technique,
involves the use of the practitioner’s hands to focus and facilitate healing (368).
MASSAGE FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC CTS
Not Recommended
Massage is not recommended for most patients for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic
CTS.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome combined with forearm myofascial pain sufficient for
the patient to require treatment. Generally, the patient should have failed other treatments
including splints and glucocorticosteroid injection.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Three to four appointments. Objective evidence of improvement should be followed.
Additional 3 or 4 treatments should be based on incremental improvement in objective
measures.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution, failure to objectively improve, or intolerance.

Rationale
There is no quality evidence of efficacy for massage as a treatment for CTS. There is one
moderate-quality trial that suggested Madenci hand massage was effective as a combined
therapy; however, the study design includes significant contact time biases and multiple
unquantified co-interventions (Madenci et al., 2012). Regardless, massage is not thought to
be helpful for typical CTS patients. However, some patients with forearm myofascial pain
are thought to potentially derive some benefits. Objective measures should be followed
documenting improvement in order for additional treatments to be added. Massage is not
invasive, has few adverse effects, but is moderately costly over time.

THERAPEUTIC ULTRASOUND
Ultrasound has been used to treat many MSDs including CTS (369,370-373).
ULTRASOUND FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC CTS IN SELECT PATIENTS WHO FAIL
SPLINT USE OR DECLINE INJECTION
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against ultrasound for treatment of acute, subacute, or
chronic CTS.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
The highest quality trial found ultrasound to be ineffective compared with sham ultrasound
where both groups were treated with splinting (Yildiz et al., 2011). One moderate-quality
study found modest efficacy comparing ultrasound with placebo (Ebenbichler et al., 1998).
Another study had no placebo control and found ultrasound superior to low level laser
therapy (Bakhtiary et al., 2004). One trial found ultrasound comparable to
glucocorticosteroid injection (Bilgici et al., 2010). The remaining quality studies included cointerventions (Baysal et al., 2006, Davis et al., 1998) or had a lower quality rating and mostly
suggested lack of efficacy (Oztas et al., 1998).
Ultrasound is not invasive, has few adverse effects, and is moderate to high cost depending
on the number of treatments (which were numerous in the quality studies). As the available
studies substantially conflict, there is no recommendation for or against therapeutic
ultrasound. Ultrasound may be a reasonable option for highly select patients with mild to
moderate CTS who decline glucocorticoid injection, have received insufficient response to
splinting, and are not thought to be surgical release candidates; in such cases, a set of 4-6
treatments may be reasonable with a successive set of 4-6 appointments based on

incremental functional gain. However, some evidence suggests possible efficacy of
phonophoresis (see phonophoresis).

considered for inclusion 11 from PubMed, 0 from Scopus, 2 from CINAHL, 0 from Cochrane
Library and 0 from other sources. Of the 18 articles considered for inclusion, 13 randomized
trials and 1 systematic review met the inclusion criteria.

ELECTRICAL THERAPIES
Phonophoresis involves the use of ultrasound to deliver topically applied drugs and has
been used to treat patients with CTS (374). Iontophoresis, a drug-delivery system that utilizes
electrical current to transdermally deliver either glucocorticosteroids or NSAIDs, has been
used to treat distal upper extremity MSDs including CTS (374,375,376). It is believed to be more
efficacious in situations where the dermis and adipose tissue overlying the target tissue is
thin which facilitates penetration of the pharmaceutical to the target tissue and may be
somewhat of an obstacle for treatment of CTS.
PHONOPHORESIS FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC CTS
Recommended
Phonophoresis is recommended for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
CTS that is sufficiently symptomatic to warrant treatment. Patients should generally be
given splints and/or a glucocorticosteroid injection prior to considering phonophoresis as a
splint or injection are believed to be more effective.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
The regimen in the highest quality study consisted of 5-15 sessions per week for 4-8 weeks
with ketoprofen phonophoresis (PH) (Bakhtiary et al., 2013), US pulse mode (1:4) with 2. 5%
ketoprofen gel at 1 MHz frequency and 1 W/cm2 intensity (Yildiz et al., 2011).
Dexamethasone has also been successfully used (Soyupek et al., 2012, Bakhtiary et al.,

2013), with one trial suggesting the steroid is superior to NSAID (diclofenac) (Soyupek et al.,
2012). Other NSAIDs and glucocorticoids are presumably equally efficacious (Yildiz et al.,
2011).
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution, failure to objectively improve or intolerance.
Rationale
One high-quality comparative trial found ketoprofen phonophoresis plus splinting superior
to ultrasound plus splinting (Yildiz et al., 2011). One moderate quality comparative trial
found dexamethasone administered by phonophoresis superior to iontophoresis (Bakhtiary
et al., 2013). One moderate quality comparative trial found phonophoresis with
glucocorticoid superior to phonophoresis with diclofenac or splinting (Soyupek et al., 2012).
Phonophoresis is not invasive, has low adverse effects, and is moderately costly. However,
phonophoresis with either NSAID or dexamethasone is recommended particularly where
splinting is insufficiently controlling symptoms and an injection is declined.

Rationale
Iontophoresis has been studied for the treatment of CTS. There is one moderate-quality
study comparing iontophoresis with dexamethasone versus distilled water which reported
no benefit (Amirjani et al., 2009). However, it was small in size (n = 20) and appears
underpowered. The other moderate-quality study found injection to be superior (Gokoglu et
al., 2005). There is no quality study of sufficient size comparing iontophoresis with placebo,
precluding an assessment of quality evidence of efficacy. Iontophoresis with
glucocorticosteroid may be a reasonable option for treating patients who decline injection;
however, oral glucocorticosteroids have quality evidence of efficacy and may be
recommended preferentially as iontophoresis is believed to be less effective than
glucocorticosteroid injections (Gokoglu et al., 2005). Iontophoresis is not invasive, has low
adverse effects, and is of moderate cost. However, other treatments have documented
efficacy and should be used preferentially.

HOT AND COLD THERAPIES
Ice has been rarely used to treat CTS. Various forms of heat treatment have sometimes
been used to treat CTS (377). Diathermy is a type of heat treatment that has been used
clinically to heat tissue (378,379). There are two forms of diathermy – short wave and
microwave. High-dose diathermy is also used to coagulate tissue. Proponents of diathermy
utilize it to treat a wide range of conditions, believing it penetrates deeper than hot packs or
heating pads and stimulates healing (379,380).

Rationale
There are no quality studies suggesting ice is effective for treatment of CTS. Ice is not

other treatments should be used in preference.

Rationale
There are no quality studies suggesting heat is effective for treatment of CTS. There is one

DIATHERMY FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC CTS
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against use of diathermy for treatment of acute,
subacute, or chronic CTS.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies clearly demonstrating that diathermy is effective for treatment
of CTS. The two available trials have considerable methodological flaws (e.g., represented as
double blinded). Diathermy is not invasive, has no adverse effects, but becomes moderately
costly with repeated applications. It has not been clearly shown to be efficacious and other
treatments have documented benefit, thus it is suggested other treatments should be used
in preference.

INJECTION THERAPIES
Four major types of injections have been utilized to treat patients with CTS. These include:
1) carpal tunnel injections with glucocorticosteroids (discussed previously); 2) carpal tunnel
injections with insulin among diabetics; 3) intramuscular glucocorticosteroid injections; and
4) botulinum injections.
Steroid injections of the carpal canal are frequently performed to treat CTS patients
(323,335,374,376,381-395)
, including those with acute cases (i.e., those that typically occur with
fractures, trauma, or unaccustomed high-force use and present primarily with acute flexor
wrist pain). (856-858) While various injection techniques have been utilized (including distal
to proximal), the most common technical injection approach utilizes a fine gauge needle

(e.g., 27- or 25-gauge) entering the skin near the distal wrist crease to the medial (ulnar)
side of palmaris longus, and angled approximately 45 degrees distally. While it has been
suggested that these injections are underutilized (396), steroid injections should be done by
those experienced with administering these injections.
Intramuscular injections have been used to treat CTS (394). Treatment of CTS with carpal
tunnel insulin injections has been attempted (326,397).
CARPAL TUNNEL INJECTIONS FOR TREATMENT OF SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC CTS
Recommended
Carpal tunnel injections are strongly recommended for the treatment of subacute or chronic
CTS.
Strength of evidence Strongly Recommended, Evidence (A)
Level of confidence High
Indications
CTS unresponsive to nocturnal wrist splinting, generally with symptoms lasting at least 3
weeks. It is not believed to be necessary to perform EDX prior to injections.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
One high-quality study found lower 1-year surgery rates with methylprednisolone 80mg vs.
40 mg of 73% vs. 81%, which were also superior to placebo (Atroshi et al., 2013). Generally,
at least 40mg of methylprednisolone or equivalent is recommended as the minimum initial
dose. Although optimum dose remains unclear, evidence in total includes evaluations with
methylprednisolone acetate (12, 15, 20, 40, 60, 80 mg), betamethasone (6. 0, 6. 4 mg),
triamcinolone hexacetonide (20, 40, 80 mg), and hydrocortisone (25, 100 mg) in quality
studies. Some physicians increase the dose in proportion to perceived symptom severity.
However, there is no quality evidence to support this practice. The type of steroid to inject
and whether to use a depot preparation, are also unclear as there are no quality studies
comparing the various preparations commonly utilized. Most physicians include at least 1mL
of an injectable anesthetic (e.g., 1% lidocaine). Lidocaine allows for rapid assessment
immediately after the injection. The limitation of using an anesthetic as an adjuvant is that
the numbness that ensues afterwards may limit a patient’s activities. Thus, a shorterduration anesthetic such as lidocaine is recommended.
A single injection and the results carefully evaluated to document improvement, even if
short-term as it is believed to have considerable prognostic significance. There is no
evidence that a series of injections is efficacious, although it has been argued that two
injections are ideal (Andreu et al., 2006). There is no evidence that there is a limit to the
number of injections to treat an episode or in a lifetime. Failure to respond, particularly if
the median nerve was successfully anesthetized by the injection, should result in a careful
re-assessment of the accuracy of the diagnosis of CTS. A second injection, typically utilizing a
moderately higher dose, may be indicated if there has been insufficient but partial relief, or
if the first injection was thought to have not entered the carpal canal.

Indications for discontinuation
No partial response to carpal tunnel injection(s), then no recommendation for additional
injection(s). Patients who fail to even partially respond to injections are a priori suspected to
not have CTS and a thorough search for an alternate diagnosis should ensue. Patients who
respond to carpal tunnel injections, but redevelop symptoms are believed to be ideal
candidates for surgical release.
Rationale
There is strong consistent evidence that carpal tunnel injections are efficacious with
superiority to placebo (Celiker et al., 2002, Ucan et al., 2006, Aygul et al., 2005, Gokoglu et
al., 2005, Armstrong et al., 2004, Dammers et al., 2006, Habib et al., 2006, Hui et al., 2005,
Ozdogan et al., 1984, Atroshi et al., 2013). There also is evidence that injections are superior
to oral glucocorticosteroids (Wong et al., 2001) and iontophoresis with glucocorticosteroids
(Gokoglu et al., 2005). Most data suggest superiority of ultrasound guidance compared with
blind injections, although cost-effectiveness of ultrasound guidance has not been reported.
As evidence somewhat conflicts, use of ultrasound for guidance should be for those with
training and experience in its use and with nominal (if any) added cost for imaging (Eslamian
F, 2017, Lee JY, 2014, Babaei-Ghazani A, 2018, Ustun et al., 2013)(Makhlouf T, 2014, Finnoff
JT, 2015). Duration of improvements after injection is controversial and may differ by CTS
severity. Nearly all quality studies required electrodiagnostic confirmation and many had
patients with symptoms lasting years, suggesting more severely affected patients benefited.
In such patients, injections may be somewhat less efficacious than in patients with more
recent or mild symptoms that are seen initially in primary care settings. Aside from local
tenderness among 50% of patients lasting a mean 1. 2 days (Wang et al., 2003), long-term
complications are rare. Long-term outcomes are somewhat controversial. One study of 30
patients found 11. 4% remained asymptomatic over an 80-week observation period with
more undergoing surgery if treatment had been via an oral steroid than via an injection.
Other studies reported only 22% of injected patients were subsequently referred for surgery
during 1 year of follow-up (Dammers et al., 2006). Steroid injections into the carpal tunnel
are minimally invasive, have minimal adverse effects, and are moderately costly. These
injections provide lasting relief of at least intermediate-term durations in a majority of CTS
patients. They are strongly recommended for treatment of subacute or chronic CTS. Carpal
tunnel injections are also recommended by consensus of the Evidence-based Practice Hand,
Wrist, and Forearm Panel for treatment of acute CTS in cases where there are no fractures.
There are no quality studies of these clinical cases; however, these injections are thought to
be the best treatment for acute CTS presentations.

CARPAL TUNNEL INJECTIONS FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE CTS WITHOUT FRACTURE
Recommended
Carpal tunnel injections are recommended for treatment of acute CTS without fractures.
Acute CTS with fractures should be referred for potential emergent surgical release.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
CTS unresponsive to nocturnal wrist splinting, generally with symptoms lasting at least 3
weeks. It is not believed to be necessary to perform EDX prior to injections.
Indications for discontinuation
No partial response to carpal tunnel injection(s), then no recommendation for additional
injection(s). Patients who fail to even partially respond to injections are a priori suspected to
not have CTS and a thorough search for an alternate diagnosis should ensue. Patients who
respond to carpal tunnel injections, but redevelop symptoms are believed to be ideal

INSULIN INJECTIONS FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC CTS
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against use of insulin injections for treatment of acute,
subacute, or chronic CTS.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There is one quality study which included CTS patients that suggests benefit from 7 weekly
injections of insulin (Ozkul et al., 2001). A second moderate quality trial found a lack of
benefits compared with physiotherapy (Ashraf et al., 2009). The consensus of the Evidencebased Practice Hand, Wrist, and Forearm Panel is that these results require replication.
Applicability of these results, even if confirmed, are suggested to be relatively limited to a
narrow subset of diabetic patients with CTS who fail to improve with other therapies and
either decline surgery or have significant symptoms of focal intracarpal nerve dysfunction
after surgery. These injections are invasive, may have adverse effects that also require
ascertainment, and are moderate to high cost. There is no recommendation for or against
insulin injections for treatment of diabetic patients with CTS.

BOTULINUM INJECTIONS FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC CTS
Not Recommended
Botulinum injections are not recommended for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic
CTS.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There is one quality study that included CTS patients that does not show clear benefit from
botulinum injections, but did show weakness in two patients lasting a few weeks (Breuer et
al., 2006). There are no other quality studies identified for management of other distal
upper extremity disorders, including tendinoses. Botulinum injections are invasive, have
adverse effects when the effects of the toxin are beyond the site where they were injected
that include fatalities (US Food and Drug Administration, 2009, Li et al., 2005), and are
costly. They are not recommended for management of CTS.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL and
Cochrane Library without date limits using the following terms: botulinum toxin, botox or
botulinum Injection, carpal tunnel syndrome, median neuropathy, CTS, carpal tunnel,

SURGERY
OVERVIEW
Surgical consultation may be indicated for CTS patients who:
●
Have red flags of a serious nature;
●
Fail to respond to non-surgical management including worksite modifications; or
●
Have clear clinical and special study evidence of a lesion that has been shown to
benefit, in both the short and long term, from surgical intervention.
Surgical considerations depend on the confirmed diagnosis of the presenting hand or wrist
complaint. If surgery is a consideration, counseling regarding likely outcomes, risks, and
benefits, and especially expectations is important. If there is no clear indication for surgery,

referring the patient to a clinician experienced in non-operative treatment of CTS may aid in
formulating a treatment plan.
Treatment of CTS with surgical release of the carpal flexor retinaculum has been utilized for
many decades with surgical case series suggesting significant benefits (312,400-426). In the late
1980s, endoscopic releases were reported, gained prominence, utilized various equipment
(417,418,427-436)
, and were initially reported as superior to open releases (430,434,437-441). However,
the endoscopic technique reportedly has a higher incidence of injuries to the nerve,
particularly in inexperienced surgical hands, as well as higher rates of incomplete surgical
releases (442). A large endoscopically treated case series of 2,402 cases involving 1,698
patients reported an overall success rate of 95% and recurrence rate of 0.5% in experienced
hands (429). More recently, the open technique has been revised towards a minimal
incisional technique (443) and continues to be successfully performed with little apparent
difference in outcome versus endoscopic releases (444-447). Currently, there is a trend towards
performing these minor surgical releases in uncomplicated patients in clinics as opposed to
in hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers that is facilitating return to work on the same day
as surgery.
Many adjunctive procedures and modifications of surgical release have been attempted in
order to obtain better clinical results. These include neurolysis, epineurotomy,
epineurectomy, tenosynovectomy, excision of the carpal ligament, cutaneous nerve sparing,
two small open incisions, use of a Knifelight, hypothenar fat pad and other flaps, and
concomitant release of the ulnar nerve in Guyon’s canal (448-463).
Most, but not all surgical studies required patients to have preoperative confirmation with
electrodiagnostic studies (EDS), although the EDS criteria are usually not specified. How
results compare among those without EDS confirmation is unclear. Risks of surgical
decompression include complications of anesthesia (addressed separately in this
document), wound infection, complex regional pain syndrome, and damage to the median
nerve (417,418,464,465). Incomplete decompression or recurrence of symptoms can lead to the
need for further surgery. Early return to work is the main cost driver regardless of the type
of carpal tunnel surgical approach utilized. Early return to work appears more dependent on
the attitude of the employer and patient than on the surgical technique (466), with selfemployed patients incurring less lost work time (466). The durations of lost time have been
shown to vary from days to weeks, further suggesting that surgical approaches are not the
primary determinants of return-to-work status.
FOLLOW-UP CARE
Carpal tunnel surgical patients usually have a good recovery, although it can be variable and
determined by many factors, including severity of the condition, surgical results,
complications, coexisting medical conditions, motivation, pain tolerance, compliance with
post-operative instructions, speed of returning to activities of daily living, and speed of
returning to work. Carpal tunnel release patients have undergone numerous formal
rehabilitation programs. However, as the surgical procedure has become less invasive, the
overall trend is towards less formal rehabilitation or courses with fewer appointments. In an
increasing number of cases this now includes home exercises and graded increased use.
Rehabilitation has included range-of-motion exercises, strengthening exercises, splinting,
and a virtual reality system (467). Home exercise programs appear to be the most effective
for regaining function (468).

Most patients require one or two follow-up clinical appointments for wound care and
instructions. Patients with less optimal outcomes may require additional appointments to
monitor and facilitate recovery. Patients with physically demanding jobs whose initial
restrictions are not accommodated may require a greater number of appointments to
monitor their recovery and help facilitate their return to work at appropriate intervals.
While most recovery occurs within the first 3 months after surgery, a full functional recovery
from carpal tunnel release including attaining a maximum grip strength is estimated to
minimally occur at 6 months and for some patients as long as 1 year. For more information
regarding post-operative rehabilitation, see section on Post-Operative Rehabilitation and
Rehabilitation of Patients with Functional Deficits: CTS and Other Disorders.

CARPAL TUNNEL RELEASE
SURGICAL RELEASE FOR TREATMENT OF SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC CARPAL TUNNEL
SYNDROME (CTS)
Recommended
Surgical release is strongly recommended for patients who fail nonoperative treatment for
subacute or chronic CTS (Sennwald et al., 1995, Agee et al., 1992, Brown et al., 1993,
Erdmann, 1994, Saw et al., 2003, Trumble et al., 2002, Atroshi et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al.,
2002, Jacobsen et al., 1996, MacDermid et al., 2003, Atroshi et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003).
It is also recommended for patients who have emergent or urgent indications (e.g., acute
compression due to fracture, arthritides, or compartment syndrome with unrelenting
symptoms of nerve impairment).
Strength of evidence Strongly Recommended, Evidence (A)
Level of confidence High
Indications
Paresthesias in at least two median-nerve served digits and symptoms that are either
nocturnal or on provocative testing.
Patients should have failure of at least two nonoperative treatments (i.e., nocturnal wrist
splinting, physical activity modifications if high exposure(s), glucocorticosteroid injection,
oral glucocorticosteroids, phonophoresis).
Surgical release is also indicated for severe symptoms such as continuous tingling and
numbness in a median nerve distribution.
Surgical release candidates should have either a confirmatory electrodiagnostic study
interpreted as consistent with median mononeuropathy OR symptom improvement or
resolution with glucocorticosteroid injection.

The decision to undergo surgery is typically driven by nocturnal symptoms.

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

119

Mild CTS with normal EDS exists, but a clinical impression of moderate or severe CTS with
normal EDS is very rare and generally indicates a mistaken diagnosis. Positive EDS in
asymptomatic individuals is very common, is not CTS, and suggests the need to carefully
select patients for EDS and properly interpret the results.
Re-operation is potentially indicated if:
●
there was a prolonged period of symptom improvement (>12 months) after surgical
release and then symptoms recurred, or there is
●
clinical evidence of an incomplete release.
Patients not improving after an initial surgery should undergo a thorough diagnostic
evaluation.
Rationale
Evidence that surgery is effective is strong. Six quality studies have compared carpal tunnel
release with other interventions. Three quality studies document superiority compared with
splinting (Gerritsen et al., 2002, Ucan et al., 2006, Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006). Two of three
studies suggest superiority of surgical release compared with injection (Ucan et al., 2006,
Hui et al., 2005, Ly-Pen et al., 2005, Ly-Pen et al., 2005) over longer timeframes mostly of 1
year. One study suggested superiority compared with physical therapy (Jarvik et al., 2009).
These appear to indicate a slight superiority of surgery to injection over 1 year and a
modestly stronger benefit compared with nocturnal splinting. Longer-term outcomes are
believed to further favor surgery.
Seventeen quality trials have compared open versus endoscopic techniques (Dumontier et
al., 1995, Sennwald et al., 1995, Agee et al., 1992, Brown et al., 1993, Erdmann, 1994, Saw
et al., 2003, Trumble et al., 2002, Atroshi et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002, Jacobsen et al.,
1996, MacDermid et al., 2003, Atroshi et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003, Ejiri et al., 2012, Kang
et al., 2013, Larsen et al., 2013, Tarallo et al., 2014, Aslani et al., 2012). Six of 11 studies
reported since 2000 have failed to demonstrate better outcomes with endoscopic releases
(Atroshi et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002, MacDermid et al., 2003, Atroshi et al., 2009,
Wong et al., 2003, Ejiri et al., 2012, Kang et al., 2013, Larsen et al., 2013, Tarallo et al., 2014,
Aslani et al., 2012), which appears to be due to the successful use of minimal incisional
techniques that utilize incisions as small as 2cm. These small incisions appear to have
removed the primary advantage of endoscopic releases. Quality evidence of superiority of
endoscopic versus minimal incisional releases is now lacking and one study has reported no
differences at 5-year follow-up, also importantly documenting no differences in reoperation
rates (Atroshi et al., 2009). Differences in recovery time between the endoscopic or
minimally invasive techniques reported mostly in the 1990s appear to have largely or
completely disappeared in the 2000s with 4 (Atroshi et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002,
MacDermid et al., 2003, Atroshi et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003), of 6 studies (Saw et al.,
2003, Trumble et al., 2002) showing a lack of superiority of the endoscopic release (Atroshi
et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002, Jacobsen et al., 1996, Macdermid et al., 2012, Atroshi et
al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003). However, it is the surgeon’s experience and comfort that are
the determining factors in the selection of the procedure performed.

Overall, the available evidence suggests either the open or endoscopic procedures are
successful surgical procedures. Thus, the Evidence-based Practice Hand, Wrist, and Forearm
Panel agreed regarding the overall recommendation for surgery. The mini-procedures
continue to improve outcomes (Jugovac et al., 2002), while most early studies compared
endoscopic to the traditional open procedure. Outcome measures vary with each study
making a direct comparison difficult. Studies have shown that with well-motivated
individuals and a mini-palm technique, return to modified work the next day is possible
(Mackinnon et al., 1991).
Recently, a Knifelight has been utilized for carpal tunnel releases (Bhattacharya et al., 2004,
Helm et al., 2003). This technique involves use of an instrument through a small palmar
incision to perform a blinded division of the flexor retinaculum. While there is sufficient
quality evidence to document efficacy and recommend the procedure (Bhattacharya et al.,
2004, Helm et al., 2003), further studies are needed comparing the Knifelight with a
standardized, minimal incisional technique and using larger sample sizes.
There have been many alterations on standard operative techniques (Menovsky et al., 2004)
and/or adjunct surgical procedures performed to attempt to derive superior outcomes for
patients who have been subjected to quality studies. Without exception, none of the
following were found beneficial – epineurotomy (Blair et al., 1992, Borisch et al., 2003,
Leinberry et al., 1997, Foulkes et al., 1994, Crnkovic et al., 2012), neurolysis (Lowry et al.,
1988, Mackinnon et al., 1991), flexor tenosynovectomy (Shum et al., 2002), flexor
retinacular lengthening (Crnkovic et al., 2012), nerve sparing incisions (Siegmeth et al.,
2006), double-limited incisions (Zyluk et al., 2006), ulnar incisions (Citron et al., 1997), and
ulnar bursal preservation (Forward et al., 2006). Evidence indicates that even in the
presence of synovial hypertrophy and histological changes, tenosynovectomy has not been
shown to be beneficial in a moderate-quality study (Shum et al., 2002). However, biopsy of
abnormal tissue is indicated for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Examples of potential
findings to be sought include amyloidosis, infectious agents, and evidence for inflammatory
conditions.
The primary cost driver for CTS claims is lost work time (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006). CTS is
not different from other MSDs, with reportedly worse outcomes and greater delays in
return to work among patients receiving workers’ compensation (Agee et al., 1992,
MacDermid et al., 2003). In quality studies, lost time ranged from 12 days for open releases
in the Netherlands (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006) to 88 days for endoscopically treated
patients in Sweden (Atroshi et al., 2006), with most trials reporting these data between 12
and 40 days (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006, Dumontier et al., 1995, Agee et al., 1992,
Erdmann, 1994, Saw et al., 2003, Trumble et al., 2002, Ferdinand et al., 2002, Jacobsen et
al., 1996, Bhattacharya et al., 2004, Helm et al., 2003, Provinciali et al., 2000). There is no
clear pattern by country or procedure, other than a propensity for greater lost time in the
1990s in the open release groups compared with the endoscopic releases, prior to the
dissemination of limited incisional techniques.

OPEN OR ENDOSCOPIC RELEASE FOR SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC CARPAL TUNNEL
SYNDROME (CTS)
Recommended
Either open or endoscopic release is moderately recommended for treatment of subacute
or chronic CTS. With either open or endoscopic, the effectiveness results from complete
division of the flexor retinaculum. The procedure that the surgeon is most comfortable
performing is recommended (Atroshi et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002, MacDermid et al.,
2003, Atroshi et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003).
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Paresthesias in at least two median-nerve served digits and symptoms that are either
nocturnal or on provocative testing.
Patients should have failure of at least two nonoperative treatments (i.e., nocturnal wrist
splinting, physical activity modifications if high exposure(s), glucocorticosteroid injection,
oral glucocorticosteroids, phonophoresis).
Surgical release is also indicated for severe symptoms such as continuous tingling and
numbness in a median nerve distribution.

normal EDS exists, but a clinical impression of moderate or severe CTS with normal EDS is
very rare and generally indicates a mistaken diagnosis. Positive EDS in asymptomatic
individuals is very common, is not CTS, and suggests the need to carefully select patients for
EDS and properly interpret the results. Re-operation is potentially indicated if:
●
there was a prolonged period of symptom improvement (>12 months) after surgical
release and then symptoms recurred, or there is
●
clinical evidence of an incomplete release.
Patients not improving after an initial surgery should undergo a thorough diagnostic
evaluation.
Benefits
Resolution of symptoms and improved function.
Harms
Rare complications include infection, CRPS.
Rationale
Evidence that surgery is effective is strong. Six quality studies have compared carpal tunnel
release with other interventions. Three quality studies document superiority compared with
splinting (Gerritsen et al., 2002, Ucan et al., 2006, Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006). Two of three
studies suggest superiority of surgical release compared with injection (Ucan et al., 2006,
Hui et al., 2005, Ly-Pen et al., 2005, Ly-Pen et al., 2005) over longer timeframes mostly of 1
year. One study suggested superiority compared with physical therapy (Jarvik et al., 2009).
These appear to indicate a slight superiority of surgery to injection over 1 year and a
modestly stronger benefit compared with nocturnal splinting. Longer-term outcomes are
believed to further favor surgery.
Seventeen quality trials have compared open versus endoscopic techniques (Dumontier et
al., 1995, Sennwald et al., 1995, Agee et al., 1992, Brown et al., 1993, Erdmann, 1994, Saw
et al., 2003, Trumble et al., 2002, Atroshi et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002, Jacobsen et al.,
1996, MacDermid et al., 2003, Atroshi et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003, Ejiri et al., 2012, Kang
et al., 2013, Larsen et al., 2013, Tarallo et al., 2014, Aslani et al., 2012). Six of 11 studies
reported since 2000 have failed to demonstrate better outcomes with endoscopic releases
(Atroshi et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002, MacDermid et al., 2003, Atroshi et al., 2009,
Wong et al., 2003, Ejiri et al., 2012, Kang et al., 2013, Larsen et al., 2013, Tarallo et al., 2014,
Aslani et al., 2012), which appears to be due to the successful use of minimal incisional
techniques that utilize incisions as small as 2cm. These small incisions appear to have
removed the primary advantage of endoscopic releases. Quality evidence of superiority of
endoscopic versus minimal incisional releases is now lacking and one study has reported no
differences at 5-year follow-up, also importantly documenting no differences in reoperation
rates (Atroshi et al., 2009). Differences in recovery time between the endoscopic or
minimally invasive techniques reported mostly in the 1990s appear to have largely or
completely disappeared in the 2000s with 4 (Atroshi et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002,

MacDermid et al., 2003, Atroshi et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003), of 6 studies (Saw et al.,
2003, Trumble et al., 2002) showing a lack of superiority of the endoscopic release (Atroshi
et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002, Jacobsen et al., 1996, Macdermid et al., 2012, Atroshi et
al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003). However, it is the surgeon’s experience and comfort that are
the determining factors in the selection of the procedure performed.
Overall, the available evidence suggests either the open or endoscopic procedures are
successful surgical procedures. Thus, the Evidence-based Practice Hand, Wrist, and Forearm
Panel agreed regarding the overall recommendation for surgery. The mini-procedures
continue to improve outcomes (Jugovac et al., 2002), while most early studies compared
endoscopic to the traditional open procedure. Outcome measures vary with each study
making a direct comparison difficult. Studies have shown that with well-motivated
individuals and a mini-palm technique, return to modified work the next day is possible
(Mackinnon et al., 1991).
Recently, a Knifelight has been utilized for carpal tunnel releases (Bhattacharya et al., 2004,
Helm et al., 2003). This technique involves use of an instrument through a small palmar
incision to perform a blinded division of the flexor retinaculum. While there is sufficient
quality evidence to document efficacy and recommend the procedure (Bhattacharya et al.,
2004, Helm et al., 2003), further studies are needed comparing the Knifelight with a
standardized, minimal incisional technique and using larger sample sizes.
There have been many alterations on standard operative techniques (Menovsky et al., 2004)
and/or adjunct surgical procedures performed to attempt to derive superior outcomes for
patients who have been subjected to quality studies. Without exception, none of the
following were found beneficial – epineurotomy (Blair et al., 1992, Borisch et al., 2003,
Leinberry et al., 1997, Foulkes et al., 1994, Crnkovic et al., 2012), neurolysis (Lowry et al.,
1988, Mackinnon et al., 1991), flexor tenosynovectomy (Shum et al., 2002), flexor
retinacular lengthening (Crnkovic et al., 2012), nerve sparing incisions (Siegmeth et al.,
2006), double-limited incisions (Zyluk et al., 2006), ulnar incisions (Citron et al., 1997), and
ulnar bursal preservation (Forward et al., 2006). Evidence indicates that even in the
presence of synovial hypertrophy and histological changes, tenosynovectomy has not been
shown to be beneficial in a moderate-quality study (Shum et al., 2002). However, biopsy of
abnormal tissue is indicated for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Examples of potential
findings to be sought include amyloidosis, infectious agents, and evidence for inflammatory
conditions.
The primary cost driver for CTS claims is lost work time (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006). CTS is
not different from other MSDs, with reportedly worse outcomes and greater delays in
return to work among patients receiving workers’ compensation (Agee et al., 1992,
MacDermid et al., 2003). In quality studies, lost time ranged from 12 days for open releases
in the Netherlands (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006) to 88 days for endoscopically treated
patients in Sweden (Atroshi et al., 2006), with most trials reporting these data between 12
and 40 days (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006, Dumontier et al., 1995, Agee et al., 1992,
Erdmann, 1994, Saw et al., 2003, Trumble et al., 2002, Ferdinand et al., 2002, Jacobsen et
al., 1996, Bhattacharya et al., 2004, Helm et al., 2003, Provinciali et al., 2000). There is no
clear pattern by country or procedure, other than a propensity for greater lost time in the

KNIFELIGHT FOR SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME (CTS)
Recommended
The use of a Knifelight is recommended for treatment of subacute or chronic CTS.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Paresthesias in at least two median-nerve served digits and symptoms that are either
nocturnal or on provocative testing.
Patients should have failure of at least two non-operative treatments (i.e., nocturnal wrist
splinting, physical activity modifications if high exposure(s), glucocorticosteroid injection,
oral glucocorticosteroids, phonophoresis).
Surgical release is also indicated for severe symptoms such as continuous tingling and
numbness in a median nerve distribution.
Surgical release candidates should have either a confirmatory electrodiagnostic study
interpreted as consistent with median mononeuropathy OR symptom improvement or
resolution with glucocorticosteroid injection.

The decision to undergo surgery is typically driven by nocturnal symptoms.

Anesthetic techniques for carpal tunnel release and other hand surgery have ranged from
general anesthesia to axillary/regional blocks to local infiltration (411,469). Tourniquets have
also been used (470).
ANESTHESIA DURING CARPAL TUNNEL RELEASE
Recommended
Anesthesia, either local or regional, is recommended during carpal tunnel release.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Rationale
There are no head-to-head comparative trials for most of these anesthetic techniques, thus
evidence-based recommendations are not supportable. Ketorolac has been found useful as
an adjunct to bier blocks for hand surgery (Rivera et al., 2008).

et al., 2013, Larsen et al., 2013, Tarallo et al., 2014, Aslani et al., 2012). Six of 11 studies

techniques that utilize incisions as small as 2cm. These small incisions appear to have
removed the primary advantage of endoscopic releases. Quality evidence of superiority of
endoscopic versus minimal incisional releases is now lacking and one study has reported no

rates (Atroshi et al., 2009). Differences in recovery time between the endoscopic or
minimally invasive techniques reported mostly in the 1990s appear to have largely or
completely disappeared in the 2000s with 4 (Atroshi et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002,
MacDermid et al., 2003, Atroshi et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003), of 6 studies (Saw et al.,
2003, Trumble et al., 2002) showing a lack of superiority of the endoscopic release (Atroshi
et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002, Jacobsen et al., 1996, Macdermid et al., 2012, Atroshi et
al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003). However, it is the surgeon’s experience and comfort that are
the determining factors in the selection of the procedure performed.
Overall, the available evidence suggests either the open or endoscopic procedures are
successful surgical procedures. Thus, the Evidence-based Practice Hand, Wrist, and Forearm
Panel agreed regarding the overall recommendation for surgery. The mini-procedures
continue to improve outcomes (Jugovac et al., 2002), while most early studies compared
endoscopic to the traditional open procedure. Outcome measures vary with each study
making a direct comparison difficult. Studies have shown that with well-motivated
individuals and a mini-palm technique, return to modified work the next day is possible
(Mackinnon et al., 1991).
Recently, a Knifelight has been utilized for carpal tunnel releases (Bhattacharya et al., 2004,
Helm et al., 2003). This technique involves use of an instrument through a small palmar
incision to perform a blinded division of the flexor retinaculum. While there is sufficient
quality evidence to document efficacy and recommend the procedure (Bhattacharya et al.,
2004, Helm et al., 2003), further studies are needed comparing the Knifelight with a
standardized, minimal incisional technique and using larger sample sizes.
There have been many alterations on standard operative techniques (Menovsky et al., 2004)
and/or adjunct surgical procedures performed to attempt to derive superior outcomes for
patients who have been subjected to quality studies. Without exception, none of the
following were found beneficial – epineurotomy (Blair et al., 1992, Borisch et al., 2003,
Leinberry et al., 1997, Foulkes et al., 1994, Crnkovic et al., 2012), neurolysis (Lowry et al.,
1988, Mackinnon et al., 1991), flexor tenosynovectomy (Shum et al., 2002), flexor
retinacular lengthening (Crnkovic et al., 2012), nerve sparing incisions (Siegmeth et al.,
2006), double-limited incisions (Zyluk et al., 2006), ulnar incisions (Citron et al., 1997), and
ulnar bursal preservation (Forward et al., 2006). Evidence indicates that even in the
presence of synovial hypertrophy and histological changes, tenosynovectomy has not been
shown to be beneficial in a moderate-quality study (Shum et al., 2002). However, biopsy of
abnormal tissue is indicated for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Examples of potential
findings to be sought include amyloidosis, infectious agents, and evidence for inflammatory
conditions.
The primary cost driver for CTS claims is lost work time (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006). CTS is
not different from other MSDs, with reportedly worse outcomes and greater delays in
return to work among patients receiving workers’ compensation (Agee et al., 1992,
MacDermid et al., 2003). In quality studies, lost time ranged from 12 days for open releases
in the Netherlands (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006) to 88 days for endoscopically treated
patients in Sweden (Atroshi et al., 2006), with most trials reporting these data between 12
and 40 days (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006, Dumontier et al., 1995, Agee et al., 1992,

clear pattern by country or procedure, other than a propensity for greater lost time in the
1990s in the open release groups compared with the endoscopic releases, prior to the
dissemination of limited incisional techniques.

FLEXOR RETINACULAR LENGTHENING
FLEXOR RETINACULAR LENGTHENING FOR SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC CTS
Not Recommended
Flexor retinacular lengthening is moderately not recommended.
Strength of evidence Moderately Not Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
Evidence that surgery is effective is strong. Six quality studies have compared carpal tunnel
release with other interventions. Three quality studies document superiority compared with
splinting (Gerritsen et al., 2002, Ucan et al., 2006, Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006). Two of three
studies suggest superiority of surgical release compared with injection (Ucan et al., 2006,
Hui et al., 2005, Ly-Pen et al., 2005, Ly-Pen et al., 2005) over longer timeframes mostly of 1
year. One study suggested superiority compared with physical therapy (Jarvik et al., 2009).
These appear to indicate a slight superiority of surgery to injection over 1 year and a
modestly stronger benefit compared with nocturnal splinting. Longer-term outcomes are
believed to further favor surgery.
Seventeen quality trials have compared open versus endoscopic techniques (Dumontier et
al., 1995, Sennwald et al., 1995, Agee et al., 1992, Brown et al., 1993, Erdmann, 1994, Saw

Abnormal-appearing tenosynovium, including potential amyloidosis, infectious agents, or

Rationale
Evidence that surgery is effective is strong. Six quality studies have compared carpal tunnel

MacDermid et al., 2003). In quality studies, lost time ranged from 12 days for open releases
in the Netherlands (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006) to 88 days for endoscopically treated
patients in Sweden (Atroshi et al., 2006), with most trials reporting these data between 12

clear pattern by country or procedure, other than a propensity for greater lost time in the
1990s in the open release groups compared with the endoscopic releases, prior to the
dissemination of limited incisional techniques.

NEUROLYSIS
INTERNAL NEUROLYSIS FOR SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC CTS
Not Recommended
Internal neurolysis is strongly not recommended.
Strength of evidence Strongly Not Recommended, Evidence (A)
Level of confidence High
Rationale
Evidence that surgery is effective is strong. Six quality studies have compared carpal tunnel
release with other interventions. Three quality studies document superiority compared with
splinting (Gerritsen et al., 2002, Ucan et al., 2006, Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006). Two of three
studies suggest superiority of surgical release compared with injection (Ucan et al., 2006,
Hui et al., 2005, Ly-Pen et al., 2005, Ly-Pen et al., 2005) over longer timeframes mostly of 1
year. One study suggested superiority compared with physical therapy (Jarvik et al., 2009).
These appear to indicate a slight superiority of surgery to injection over 1 year and a
modestly stronger benefit compared with nocturnal splinting. Longer-term outcomes are
believed to further favor surgery.
Seventeen quality trials have compared open versus endoscopic techniques (Dumontier et
al., 1995, Sennwald et al., 1995, Agee et al., 1992, Brown et al., 1993, Erdmann, 1994, Saw
et al., 2003, Trumble et al., 2002, Atroshi et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002, Jacobsen et al.,
1996, MacDermid et al., 2003, Atroshi et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003, Ejiri et al., 2012, Kang
et al., 2013, Larsen et al., 2013, Tarallo et al., 2014, Aslani et al., 2012). Six of 11 studies
reported since 2000 have failed to demonstrate better outcomes with endoscopic releases
(Atroshi et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002, MacDermid et al., 2003, Atroshi et al., 2009,
Wong et al., 2003, Ejiri et al., 2012, Kang et al., 2013, Larsen et al., 2013, Tarallo et al., 2014,
Aslani et al., 2012), which appears to be due to the successful use of minimal incisional
techniques that utilize incisions as small as 2cm. These small incisions appear to have

removed the primary advantage of endoscopic releases. Quality evidence of superiority of
endoscopic versus minimal incisional releases is now lacking and one study has reported no
differences at 5-year follow-up, also importantly documenting no differences in reoperation
rates (Atroshi et al., 2009). Differences in recovery time between the endoscopic or
minimally invasive techniques reported mostly in the 1990s appear to have largely or
completely disappeared in the 2000s with 4 (Atroshi et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002,
MacDermid et al., 2003, Atroshi et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003), of 6 studies (Saw et al.,
2003, Trumble et al., 2002) showing a lack of superiority of the endoscopic release (Atroshi
et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002, Jacobsen et al., 1996, Macdermid et al., 2012, Atroshi et
al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003). However, it is the surgeon’s experience and comfort that are
the determining factors in the selection of the procedure performed.
Overall, the available evidence suggests either the open or endoscopic procedures are
successful surgical procedures. Thus, the Evidence-based Practice Hand, Wrist, and Forearm
Panel agreed regarding the overall recommendation for surgery. The mini-procedures
continue to improve outcomes (Jugovac et al., 2002), while most early studies compared
endoscopic to the traditional open procedure. Outcome measures vary with each study
making a direct comparison difficult. Studies have shown that with well-motivated
individuals and a mini-palm technique, return to modified work the next day is possible
(Mackinnon et al., 1991).
Recently, a Knifelight has been utilized for carpal tunnel releases (Bhattacharya et al., 2004,
Helm et al., 2003). This technique involves use of an instrument through a small palmar
incision to perform a blinded division of the flexor retinaculum. While there is sufficient
quality evidence to document efficacy and recommend the procedure (Bhattacharya et al.,
2004, Helm et al., 2003), further studies are needed comparing the Knifelight with a
standardized, minimal incisional technique and using larger sample sizes.
There have been many alterations on standard operative techniques (Menovsky et al., 2004)
and/or adjunct surgical procedures performed to attempt to derive superior outcomes for
patients who have been subjected to quality studies. Without exception, none of the
following were found beneficial – epineurotomy (Blair et al., 1992, Borisch et al., 2003,
Leinberry et al., 1997, Foulkes et al., 1994, Crnkovic et al., 2012), neurolysis (Lowry et al.,
1988, Mackinnon et al., 1991), flexor tenosynovectomy (Shum et al., 2002), flexor
retinacular lengthening (Crnkovic et al., 2012), nerve sparing incisions (Siegmeth et al.,
2006), double-limited incisions (Zyluk et al., 2006), ulnar incisions (Citron et al., 1997), and
ulnar bursal preservation (Forward et al., 2006). Evidence indicates that even in the
presence of synovial hypertrophy and histological changes, tenosynovectomy has not been
shown to be beneficial in a moderate-quality study (Shum et al., 2002). However, biopsy of
abnormal tissue is indicated for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Examples of potential
findings to be sought include amyloidosis, infectious agents, and evidence for inflammatory
conditions.
The primary cost driver for CTS claims is lost work time (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006). CTS is
not different from other MSDs, with reportedly worse outcomes and greater delays in
return to work among patients receiving workers’ compensation (Agee et al., 1992,
MacDermid et al., 2003). In quality studies, lost time ranged from 12 days for open releases

in the Netherlands (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006) to 88 days for endoscopically treated
patients in Sweden (Atroshi et al., 2006), with most trials reporting these data between 12
and 40 days (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006, Dumontier et al., 1995, Agee et al., 1992,

al., 1996, Bhattacharya et al., 2004, Helm et al., 2003, Provinciali et al., 2000). There is no
clear pattern by country or procedure, other than a propensity for greater lost time in the

ULNAR INCISIONAL APPROACH FOR SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC CTS

rates (Atroshi et al., 2009). Differences in recovery time between the endoscopic or
minimally invasive techniques reported mostly in the 1990s appear to have largely or
completely disappeared in the 2000s with 4 (Atroshi et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002,
MacDermid et al., 2003, Atroshi et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003), of 6 studies (Saw et al.,
2003, Trumble et al., 2002) showing a lack of superiority of the endoscopic release (Atroshi
et al., 2006, Ferdinand et al., 2002, Jacobsen et al., 1996, Macdermid et al., 2012, Atroshi et
al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003). However, it is the surgeon’s experience and comfort that are
the determining factors in the selection of the procedure performed.
Overall, the available evidence suggests either the open or endoscopic procedures are
successful surgical procedures. Thus, the Evidence-based Practice Hand, Wrist, and Forearm
Panel agreed regarding the overall recommendation for surgery. The mini-procedures
continue to improve outcomes (Jugovac et al., 2002), while most early studies compared

endoscopic to the traditional open procedure. Outcome measures vary with each study
making a direct comparison difficult. Studies have shown that with well-motivated
individuals and a mini-palm technique, return to modified work the next day is possible
(Mackinnon et al., 1991).
Recently, a Knifelight has been utilized for carpal tunnel releases (Bhattacharya et al., 2004,
Helm et al., 2003). This technique involves use of an instrument through a small palmar
incision to perform a blinded division of the flexor retinaculum. While there is sufficient
quality evidence to document efficacy and recommend the procedure (Bhattacharya et al.,
2004, Helm et al., 2003), further studies are needed comparing the Knifelight with a
standardized, minimal incisional technique and using larger sample sizes.
There have been many alterations on standard operative techniques (Menovsky et al., 2004)
and/or adjunct surgical procedures performed to attempt to derive superior outcomes for
patients who have been subjected to quality studies. Without exception, none of the
following were found beneficial – epineurotomy (Blair et al., 1992, Borisch et al., 2003,
Leinberry et al., 1997, Foulkes et al., 1994, Crnkovic et al., 2012), neurolysis (Lowry et al.,
1988, Mackinnon et al., 1991), flexor tenosynovectomy (Shum et al., 2002), flexor
retinacular lengthening (Crnkovic et al., 2012), nerve sparing incisions (Siegmeth et al.,
2006), double-limited incisions (Zyluk et al., 2006), ulnar incisions (Citron et al., 1997), and
ulnar bursal preservation (Forward et al., 2006). Evidence indicates that even in the
presence of synovial hypertrophy and histological changes, tenosynovectomy has not been
shown to be beneficial in a moderate-quality study (Shum et al., 2002). However, biopsy of
abnormal tissue is indicated for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Examples of potential
findings to be sought include amyloidosis, infectious agents, and evidence for inflammatory
conditions.
The primary cost driver for CTS claims is lost work time (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006). CTS is
not different from other MSDs, with reportedly worse outcomes and greater delays in
return to work among patients receiving workers’ compensation (Agee et al., 1992,
MacDermid et al., 2003). In quality studies, lost time ranged from 12 days for open releases
in the Netherlands (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006) to 88 days for endoscopically treated
patients in Sweden (Atroshi et al., 2006), with most trials reporting these data between 12
and 40 days (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006, Dumontier et al., 1995, Agee et al., 1992,
Erdmann, 1994, Saw et al., 2003, Trumble et al., 2002, Ferdinand et al., 2002, Jacobsen et
al., 1996, Bhattacharya et al., 2004, Helm et al., 2003, Provinciali et al., 2000). There is no
clear pattern by country or procedure, other than a propensity for greater lost time in the
1990s in the open release groups compared with the endoscopic releases, prior to the
dissemination of limited incisional techniques.

inclusion, 51 randomized trial and 12 systematic studies met the inclusion criteria.

PERIOPERATIVE ANTIBIOTICS
Perioperative antibiotics have been administered to patients undergoing carpal tunnel
release, most commonly as pre-incisional antibiotics rather than post-operative antibiotic
courses. Some surgeons use antibiotics in all patients. Also, some institutions have
implemented policies mandating use in all cases.
PERIOPERATIVE ANTIBIOTICS FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING CARPAL TUNNEL RELEASE
Recommended
Pre-incisional antibiotics are recommended for consideration for patients with risk factors
undergoing carpal tunnel release. Thresholds for use in other patients should be generally
low.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Patients with risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, susceptibility to infections) who are
undergoing carpal tunnel release surgery. Institutions may also mandate use through
policies.
Rationale
There are no quality studies regarding the administering of peri-operative antibiotics to
patients undergoing carpal tunnel release. Infections among these patients are quite
uncommon. Antibiotics are invasive when administered intravenously, have low adverse
effects, and are moderate to high cost depending on frequency and route of administration.
Risk factors among patients, such as diabetics or those who are susceptibility to infections,
should be considered. As noted, some institutions mandate the use of these antibiotics, and
there is no quality evidence to overturn those policies. However, routine use is not generally
recommended.

WORK RESTRICTIONS
Some physicians place work restrictions on patients with CTS; others do not. There is no
quality evidence to suggest that restrictions are required.
WORK RESTRICTIONS FOR CTS
Recommended
For patients with CTS, it is recommended that their work be restricted to those tasks that do
not involve high-force combined with repeated hand gripping or pinching or the use of high
acceleration vibrating hand-held tools.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Select patients with combined forceful and repeated use of the hands or use of high
amplitude vibrating tools. Of note, these types of jobs involve a minority of patients with
CTS.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution, lack of improvement, or desire of the patient to remove limitations.
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating workplace restrictions; thus, whether patients
improve more quickly with activity limitations has not been proven. However, based on
available evidence associating combined forceful and repeated use of the hands or use of
high amplitude vibrating tools with CTS, work restrictions are recommended for select
patients with CTS. These types of jobs involve a minority of patients with CTS. Restrictions
are not invasive, likely have few adverse effects, and may be moderate to high cost
depending on length.

FOLLOW-UP CARE
The clinical evaluation and progress of patients is most commonly monitored qualitatively
from appointment to appointment. Particularly, physicians seek information regarding the
degree to which symptoms are present and whether the patient believes there has been
improvement. However, there are several instruments that may be utilized for monitoring
the progress of patients with CTS (241). These include the DASH (242-263) and Boston Carpal
Tunnel Questionnaire (133,214,242-284). Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) has
been used in many studies as a measurement outcome of CTS (254,262,266,285). The Short Form36 (SF-36) (249,255,264), the Flinn Performance Screening Tool (FPST) (286), the Patient
Evaluation Measure questionnaire (PEM) (248,263), the Amadio questionnaire (259), the
Historical-objective-distribution based scale (Hi-Ob-Db) (267,279), and the Alderson-McGali
hand function questionnaire (AMHFQ) (264) have been used to diagnose CTS. VAS symptoms
and pain scores may also be used (249,253,264) even though many patients with CTS have no
pain. Functional status scores (133,242,255,259,265,270,274,275,277,280,282,286,287,288) and Global
Symptom Scores (289) are also used, particularly in some research studies. Grip strength
(248,253,264,271,272,277,284,290-293)
and pinch strength measures (248,253,264,269,271,272,276,283,290,292) may
be utilized. However, patients who have mild symptoms generally have normal grip
strength. All of these questionnaires are subjective and strength measures are effortdependent, although the strength measures attempt to provide a quantitative measure that
may help to gauge improvement over time especially post-operatively
(242,246,252,266,274,282,289,294,295-297)
.
Carpal tunnel surgical patients usually have a good recovery, although it can be variable and
determined by many factors, including severity of the condition, surgical results,
complications, coexisting medical conditions, motivation, pain tolerance, compliance with
post-operative instructions, speed of returning to activities of daily living, and speed of
returning to work. Carpal tunnel release patients have undergone numerous formal
rehabilitation programs. However, as the surgical procedure has become less invasive, the
overall trend is towards less formal rehabilitation or courses with fewer appointments. In an
increasing number of cases this now includes home exercises and graded increased use.
Rehabilitation has included range-of-motion exercises, strengthening exercises, splinting,
and a virtual reality system (467). Home exercise programs appear to be the most effective
for regaining function (468).
Most patients require one or two follow-up clinical appointments for wound care and
instructions. Patients with less optimal outcomes may require additional appointments to
monitor and facilitate recovery. Patients with physically demanding jobs whose initial
restrictions are not accommodated may require a greater number of appointments to
monitor their recovery and help facilitate their return to work at appropriate intervals.
While most recovery occurs within the first 3 months after surgery, a full functional recovery
from carpal tunnel release including attaining a maximum grip strength is estimated to
minimally occur at 6 months and for some patients as long as 1 year. For more information
regarding post-operative rehabilitation, see the Postoperative Rehabilitation
recommendations.

CRUSH INJURIES AND COMPARTMENT SYNDROME
OVERVIEW
Crush injuries and compartment syndrome are usually surgical emergencies that require
urgent evaluation (471,472). Patients have pain and may have paresthesia. Those with vascular
compromise may have a cool extremity compared with the unaffected limb. Crush injuries
have clear mechanisms of injury on history. However, there are many causes of
compartment syndrome including trauma, excessive traction from fractures, tight casts,
bleeding disorders, burns, snakebites, intraarterial injections, infusions, and high-pressure
injection injuries (472-477).
The initial assessment should focus on the degree of injury severity and if the injury requires
emergent surgical evaluation and treatment. Compartment pressure measurements are
helpful. The physical examination ranges from mild abnormalities with mild injuries (e.g.,
contusions) to severe with fractures, limited range(s) of motion and neurovascular
compromise. Milder injuries may be managed non-operatively; however, the threshold for
surgical consultation should be low. Those with milder injuries should be monitored for
neurovascular compromise.
Compartment pressure measurements are helpful. Mild cases of crush injuries may be
treated similar to non-specific hand, wrist, forearm pain with particular emphasis on RICE
(rest, ice, compression, elevation). Not all crush wounds, especially those more extensive
and prone towards swelling are sutured as additional problems may ensue from suturing
including possible tissue necrosis and the intervention may help to inhibit expansion to
relieve pressure.
These injuries generally require work limitations depending on task demands. More severe
cases require time away from work for recovery from surgery, pain management, and
generally require a gradual resumption of usual activities dependent on injury severity and
rate of healing.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
X-RAYS FOR EVALUATING CRUSH INJURIES OR COMPARTMENT SYNDROME
Recommended
X-rays are recommended for evaluating patients with crush injuries or compartment
syndrome.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
INITIAL CARE
Compartment pressure measurements are helpful and assist in determining the need for
emergent surgery.
ELEVATION FOR ACUTE CRUSH INJURIES OR COMPARTMENT SYNDROME

Elevation is recommended for treatment of acute crush injuries or compartment syndrome.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating rest/elevation, splinting, or self-application of ice or
heat to treat crush injuries or compartment syndrome. However, elevation, rest, and ice are
believed to be helpful for treatment of these conditions and in milder cases may be the
principal treatments administered. These interventions are not invasive, have no adverse
effects, and are not costly (other than repeated administrations of cryotherapies in hospital
settings where monitoring is required); thus, they are recommended.

FOLLOW-UP VISITS
Patients generally require multiple follow-up appointments with the number dependent on
the severity of the injury. The mildest cases of crush injuries may require 1 to 3 follow-up
appointments. Severe cases of compartment syndrome or crush injuries that have major
medical complications and activity limitations may require dozens of appointments to
evaluate, treat, advance activity limitations and otherwise monitor and actively facilitate
clinical progress. Moderate and severe crush injuries and compartment syndrome usually

exercises. Therapy needs can be extensive (see below).

ACTIVITY MODIFICATION AND EXERCISE
EXERCISE FOR CRUSH INJURIES OR COMPARTMENT SYNDROME
Sometimes Recommended
Exercise is generally not indicated acutely for crush injuries or compartment syndrome.
However, exercise may be needed in the recovery or post-operative phases.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operative, appointments should be scheduled
generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there have been functional improvements yet there
are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is often
helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week appointments)
may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe, and there is
ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g., increased
grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities, increased
duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are appropriate when
there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent objective functional
gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the therapy.

MEDICATIONS
Over-the-counter medications may be helpful, but most patients require prescription
medications for pain, particularly for moderate to severe injuries. Mannitol has been
reported as a treatment (478).
NSAIDS FOR ACUTE OR SUBACUTE CRUSH INJURIES OR COMPARTMENT SYNDROME
Recommended
NSAIDs are recommended to control pain associated with acute or subacute crush injuries
or compartment syndrome.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Pain due to acute or subacute crush injuries or compartment syndrome.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Scheduled dosage rather than as needed is generally preferable.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution of pain, lack of efficacy, development of adverse effects, particularly
gastrointestinal.
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating NSAIDs or acetaminophen for patients with crush
injuries or compartment syndrome. There is one trial with non-specific limb injury
suggesting efficacy of diclofenac (Woo et al., 2005). These medications are helpful for
numerous other musculoskeletal disorders and are believed helpful for these injuries. As
NSAIDs and acetaminophen are non-invasive, have low adverse effects, and are low cost,
they are recommended for treatment of pain associated with acute or subacute crush
injuries or compartment syndrome.

ACETAMINOPHEN FOR ACUTE OR SUBACUTE CRUSH INJURIES OR COMPARTMENT
SYNDROME
Recommended
Acetaminophen is recommended to control pain associated with acute or subacute crush
injuries or compartment syndrome.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Pain due to acute or subacute crush injuries or compartment syndrome.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Scheduled dosage rather than as needed is generally preferable.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution of pain, lack of efficacy, development of adverse effects, particularly
gastrointestinal.
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating NSAIDs or acetaminophen for patients with crush
injuries or compartment syndrome. There is one trial with non-specific limb injury
suggesting efficacy of diclofena (Woo et al., 2005). These medications are helpful for
numerous other musculoskeletal disorders and are believed helpful for these injuries. As
NSAIDs and acetaminophen are non-invasive, have low adverse effects, and are low cost,
they are recommended for treatment of pain associated with acute or subacute crush
injuries or compartment syndrome.

ALLIED HEALTH INTERVENTIONS
HYPERBARIC OXYGEN FOR ACUTE OR SUBACUTE CRUSH INJURIES OR COMPARTMENT
SYNDROME
Recommended
Hyperbaric oxygen is recommended for treatment of acute or subacute crush injuries or
compartment syndrome depending on the nature of the injury. This frequently includes
emergency fasciotomy for release of tension from compartment syndromes as well as other
surgical procedures to address fractures and other remediable defects.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There is one quality study of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) for treatment of crush injuries with
considerable benefits demonstrated including improved healing and reduced need for
additional surgeries (Bouachour et al., 1996). HBO is non-invasive and generally safe,
although it is high cost. However, HBO is recommended for treatment of patients with
moderate to severe crush injuries or compartment syndrome as risks are outweighed by
benefits.

SURGERY
SURGERY FOR ACUTE OR SUBACUTE CRUSH INJURIES OR COMPARTMENT SYNDROME
Recommended
Surgery is recommended for treatment of acute or subacute crush injuries or compartment
syndrome depending on the nature of the injury. This frequently includes emergency
fasciotomy for release of tension from compartment syndromes as well as other surgical
procedures to address fractures and other remediable defects. Compartment pressure
measurements are helpful and assist in guiding need of emergent surgery.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating surgeries for crush injuries or compartment
syndrome of the hand or forearm and the clinical variability between patients is large.
However, fasciotomies are particularly essential for treatment of significant neurovascular
compromise from compartment syndrome and is a surgical emergency (Naidu et al., 1994,
Dellaero et al., 1996, Botte et al., 1998, Friedrich et al., 2007, Gelberman et al., 1978,
Mubarak et al., 1989, Ortiz et al., 1998, Weinstein et al., 1992, Gourgiotis et al., 2007,
Hayakawa et al., 2009, Kalyani et al., 2011, Wall et al., 2010). Other procedures may be
required based on remediable defects such as fractures, ligament tears, or other injuries.

DUPUYTREN’S DISEASE
OVERVIEW
Dupuytren’s disease is a disorder of the hand involving the formation of fibrosis (scar tissue)
in the palm and digits with subsequent contractures (479). It has strong age and inheritance
patterns (480,481,482,483,484). There is insufficient evidence relating Dupuytren’s disease to
occupational activities (485,486). Purported risks include the use of alcohol, smoking, diabetes
mellitus, and epilepsy (481). However, although there are no quality studies involving
occupational factors, there are some reported associations with both heavy (487) and manual
work (488). Therefore, to help provide improved care for patients, this disorder is included as
an appendix to the Hand, Wrist, and Forearm Disorders Guideline.
Many treatments have been used for patients with Dupuytren’s disease, including
radiotherapy, dimethylsulfoxide injections, topical applications of vitamins A and E, physical
therapy, ultrasound, corticosteroid injections, 5-Fluorouracil, and gamma interferon
injections. Almost all of these treatments have been found ineffective (489). While surgery is
currently the most effective treatment for Dupuytren’s disease, the contracture often
reoccurs with time.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
RADIOTHERAPY
Radiotherapy has been used to attempt to slow or prevent the progression of Dupuytren’s
disease (490). Treatment involves irradiating the nodules and cords associated with
Dupuytren’s with x-rays or electrons.
RADIOTHERAPY FOR PREVENTION OF PROGRESSION OF DUPUYTREN’S DISEASE
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of radiotherapy to prevent the
progression of Dupuytren’s disease.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
One moderate-quality trial of radiotherapy found no differences between two types of
radiotherapy treatment regimens (Seegenschmiedt et al., 2001). However, the trial had no
placebo group and there was no comparison between treatments. In addition, results
suggested regression over 1 year. Radiotherapy is non-invasive and has moderate adverse
effects, but it is moderately costly and there is no quality evidence of its efficacy. Therefore,
there is no recommendation for or against the use of radiotherapy to prevent the
progression of Dupuytren’s disease.

MEDICATIONS
NSAIDs have been used to treat post-operative swelling from surgery for Dupuytren’s
disease and appear to be superior to acetaminophen (paracetamol) (491). Naproxen may also
be useful as an analgesic during the immediate post-operative phase (491).
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a chemotherapy drug that has been used for many years to treat
cancer, principally as a thymidylate synthase inhibitor. It is administered intravenously or as
a topical cream. 5-FU is also used in ophthalmic surgery as an anti-scarring agent, and
topically to treat actinic (solar) keratoses and some types of basal cell skin carcinomas. 5-FU
has also been used topically to attempt to slow or prevent recurrence of Dupuytren’s
disease after surgery by reducing proliferation rates of fibroblasts (487).
NSAIDS TO TREAT POST-OPERATIVE SWELLING FROM SURGERY FOR DUPUYTREN’S
DISEASE
Recommended
NSAIDs are moderately recommended to treat post-operative swelling from surgery for
Dupuytren’s disease.
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence High
Indications
Dupuytren’s disease surgical patients.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Naproxen 500mg BID. Trial utilized 3 days of treatment (Husby et al., 2001).
Rationale
There is one high-quality study evaluating the effect of drugs on acute post-operative
swelling after surgery for Dupuytren’s; it documents the efficacy and superiority of
naproxen to paracetamol, which in turn was superior to placebo (Husby et al., 2001).
Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

165

However, there is no quality evidence that other NSAIDs are inferior to naproxen. NSAIDs
and acetaminophen are non-invasive, have low adverse effects (particularly over 3 days),
and are low cost. Therefore, they are recommended to treat post-operative swelling and
pain resulting from surgery for Dupuytren’s disease.

ACETAMINOPHEN FOR DUPUYTREN’S SURGERY
Recommended
Acetaminophen is recommended for Dupuytren’s surgery.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Moderate
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Paracetamol 1g QID trialed for 3 days. (Note: an FDA advisory committee recommended a
maximum dose of 650mg and there is a suggestion of toxicity at 1g QID especially over a few
days and particularly in patients consuming excess alcohol or who have liver disease) (U. S.
Food and Drug Administration, 2009).
Rationale
There is one high-quality study evaluating the effect of drugs on acute post-operative
swelling after surgery for Dupuytren’s; it documents the efficacy and superiority of
naproxen to paracetamol, which in turn was superior to placebo (Husby et al., 2001).

5-FLUOROURACIL FOR RECURRENCE OF DUPUYTREN’S DISEASE IN SURGICAL PATIENTS
Not Recommended
5-Fluorouracil is not recommended to prevent the recurrence of Dupuytren’s disease in
surgical patients.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There is one moderate-quality trial of 5-fluorouracil administered intraoperatively which
showed no difference when compared with placebo (Bulstrode et al., 2004). 5-Fluorouracil
is not invasive, but has adverse effects and is moderately costly. Therefore, 5-Fluorouracil is

Recommended
Collagenase injections are moderately recommended for treatment of Dupuytren’s disease.
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

167

Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Dupuytren’s contractures sufficient to result in impairment, nearing impairment, or
sufficient to result in significant cosmetic deformity.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Clostridial collagenase 10,000 U injection; repeat injection(s) at 4- to 6-week intervals.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution of contracture, sufficient reduction for patient to decline additional injection,
adverse effects, or failure to respond to 3 injections.
Rationale
Quality studies evaluating the efficacy of clostridial collagenase show considerable benefits
(Badalamente et al., 2007, Badalamente et al., 2002, Gilpin et al., 2010, Hurst et al., 2009).
These injections are minimally invasive, have relatively few reported adverse effects (skin
tears if prolonged contracture), but are costly. Therefore, collagenase injections are
moderately recommended for treatment of Dupuytren’s disease. One trial recommended
post-operative manipulation but had no placebo or sham group (Mickelson et al., 2014).

SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Surgical procedures have long been used to attempt to improve range of motion in patients
with contracture from Dupuytren’s disease (486). The goal of surgical care is to excise or
incise the diseased fascia. This treatment does not cure the disease, but is meant to improve
severe debilitating joint contractures. Several types of surgery have been used to treat
Dupuytren’s disease, depending on the contracture:
●
Extensive fasciectomy involves removing as much fascia as possible, including that
which is grossly normal. Today, this procedure is not commonly performed because of

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

168

increased morbidity which often included hematoma, edema, and prolonged post-operative
stiffness.
●
Dermofasciectomy removes the diseased fascia and the overlying skin. This requires
resurfacing (covering) the wound with a full-thickness skin graft. Recurrence rates are quite
low with this approach. Because of the radical nature of this procedure, it is usually reserved
for patients with recurrent or severe disease.
●
Regional or selective fasciectomy involves excising only grossly involved fascia.
Although the disease process clearly extends into clinically normal palmar fascia, this
approach has proven successful in correcting MCP joint contractures and some PIP joint
contractures; this procedure carries an acceptably low morbidity rate. Some surgeons prefer
to leave the skin wound open to heal by secondary intention as a means of decreasing
hematoma risk. This approach is commonly used today.
SURGERY FOR TREATMENT OF DUPUYTREN’S CONTRACTURE
Recommended
Surgery using the technique of regional or selective fasciectomy is recommended for
contracture due to Dupuytren’s disease.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies comparing surgical results with non-surgical treatments or with
no treatment (Ullah et al., 2009, van Rijssen et al., 2006, Citron et al., 2005). Considering the
high propensity for Dupuytren’s contracture to progress or reoccur (estimated at 27 to 80%
after surgery) (van Rijssen et al., 2006, Citron et al., 2005, Mäkelä et al., 1991, Rodrigo et al.,
1976, Tonkin et al., 1984), surgical studies with sufficient follow-up to determine long-term
benefits are needed. However, as some patients with functional limitations appear to
improve at least in the short to intermediate term lasting many months to years, regional or
selective fasciectomy is recommended. Surgery is invasive, has known adverse
consequences including recurrences, and is costly. However, it also appears effective for at
least a limited period of time and for some patients it may be the only treatment option
available; thus, surgery is recommended particularly for patients with functional limitations.
Full-thickness skin graft has been found to be ineffective and thus is not recommended
(Ullah et al., 2009).

EXTENSOR COMPARTMENT TENOSYNOVITIS
OVERVIEW
De Quervain’s stenosing tenosynovitis involves hypertrophy of the extensor retinaculum of
the first extensor compartment involving the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis
brevis tendons with signs of tenosynovial and retinacular fibrosis usually present (495,496).
Extensor tendon entrapment generally presents as a relatively simple clinical presentation.
Some occur after acute injury, but most occur without specific inciting event.
These diagnoses are clinical. Patients without triggering will typically have tenderness that is
focal over the affected tendon(s) or compartment. Finkelstein’s maneuver should be
positive.
Patients present with wrist pain that is augmented by movement and generally nonradiating (496), although occasionally pain may spread along the course of the affected
tendon sheath (495,496). Patients rarely have paresthesias unless there is an accompanying
swelling or other mechanism to affect the superficial radial nerve or other digital nerves (495).
Some repeated hand postures with thumb pinching may be associated with de Quervain’s
disease (497). There is belief that superficial radial nerve entrapment may accompany de
Quervain’s and may then produce paresthesias in the first dorsal web space. Triggering is
rare (498).
The hand is usually normal in appearance, although there is visible tendon sheath swelling in
a minority of cases. Swelling is more common with inflammatory conditions (e.g.,
rheumatoid arthritis) or infections. Some believe swelling and crepitus are also only present
among those with peritendinitis if there is no inflammatory or infectious disease. Focal
tenderness over the compartment is present. Finkelstein’s maneuver is the classic
provocative maneuver and is nearly always present (495), however, the predictive values are
unclear. Pain in the affected compartment is generally present with use or any provocative
maneuver (e.g., resisted use of the muscle-tendon unit) (496). Triggering may be
demonstrated on rare occasions.

Follow-up visits are generally required every 1 or 2 weeks to evaluate efficacy of
interventions until resolution of the condition.
The condition may be occupational when jobs require repeated forceful gripping or
sustained wrist extension. Job modifications are thought to be needed in most of these
work-related cases to facilitate recovery (496).
However, most cases are not likely occupational. Extensor compartment tenosynovitis,
including de Quervain’s tenosynovitis, is considered a comparable disorder to trigger digit
with somewhat similar pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment issues. De
Quervain’s is the most common of the extensor compartment tendinoses. Intersection
syndrome with a reported prevalence of 0. 37% of all patients with arm or hand pain is
substantially less common (499) and is somewhat controversial regarding the actual site of
entrapment of the dorsal compartment (500,501,502) with the principal site appearing to
involve the musculotendinous junction of the first extensor compartment and the tendons
of the 2nd extensor compartment (503).
Similar clinical and pathophysiological conditions are believed to affect the flexor carpi
ulnaris and flexor carpi radialis tendons at the wrist. There is a strong predisposition in
women and among those in their 5th through 7th decades of life (495,504,505). De Quervain’s is
also considered a generally non-inflammatory condition caused by hypertrophy of extensor
retinaculum and parietal layer of the tenosynovium with resulting symptoms of pain on use
of the affected digit. Systemic diseases are potential causes, including rheumatoid arthritis,
other rheumatic disorders, diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, heredity and anatomic variants.
Work-relatedness is thought to be present in a significant proportion of cases (506,507,508),
although more recent studies have suggested less work-relatedness (19). Risk factors have
not been confirmed in cohort studies, but are thought to particularly involve combinations
of force, repetition and posture (91,495,506,507,508,509). Direct trauma over the affected extensor
compartment is reported in a minority of cases (495). Risks for intersection syndrome are not
well defined. Purported risks appear to be high-force sports related particularly if
unaccustomed including rowing, canoeing, racket sports, and weight lifting (510,511). Work
tasks reported to be risks appear similar with intensive agricultural workers (threshing,
planting, hammering, hand washing, spraying, cementing) (499) and recent job change to
supermarket cashiering being examples of reported risks (512). Discontinuation of the high
force, unaccustomed activity has been frequently reported to resolve intersection syndrome
(499,501,513,514)
. Increasing hours of computer work has been associated with extensor
compartment tenosynovitis, de Quervain’s disease, and non-specific wrist and forearm pain
(91,93)
. Those risks may be due to contact stress at the wrist or sustained wrist postures. Split
keyboards, which reduce awkward postures, have been associated with reduction in pain
and disorders (95,96).

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
These diagnoses are clinical. Patients without triggering will typically have tenderness that is
focal over the affected tendon(s) or compartment. Finkelstein’s maneuver should be
positive.

SPECIAL STUDIES FOR EXTENSOR COMPARTMENT TENOSYNOVITIS
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against special studies to diagnose extensor
compartment tenosynovitis.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no special tests that are typically performed for extensor compartment
tenosynovitis. X-rays are usually not helpful, although one study suggested minor x-ray
changes may be present (Chien et al., 2001). The threshold for testing for confounding
conditions such as diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism should be low, particularly to
prevent other morbidity. There are reports of MRI findings ; however, the utility of MRI has
not been demonstrated in quality studies. The condition should be distinguished from de
Quervain’s.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: X-Rays,
Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed, Extensor Compartment Tenosynovitis, De
Quervain's Stenosing Tenosynovitis; diagnostic, diagnosis, sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value, negative predictive value, and predictive value of tests, efficacy, and
efficiency. We found and reviewed 13 articles in PubMed, 7 in Scopus, 1 in CINAHL, 0 in
Cochrane Library, and 393 from Google Scholar. We considered for inclusion 1 from
PubMed, 0 from Scopus, 0 from CINAHL, from Google Scholar, 0 from Cochrane Library and
0 from other sources. Of the 1 article considered for inclusion, 1 diagnostic study met the
inclusion criteria.
MRI TO DIAGNOSE EXTENSOR COMPARTMENT TENOSYNOVITIS
Recommended
MRI is recommended to diagnose extensor compartment tenosynovitis.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are two moderate-quality articles (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2015, Parellada et al., 2007)
evaluating the use of MRIs to diagnose extensor compartment tenosynovitis. However, the
vast majority of cases are readily diagnosed clinically, obviating the need for imaging. MRI
may be reasonable in select circumstances where there is unclear diagnosis, and/or lack of
appropriate response to clinical treatments, especially injections.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
INITIAL CARE
Initial care usually involves limitation of the physical factors thought to be contributing (496).
Thumb spica splints for de Quervain’s and wrist braces for the other compartment
tendinoses are generally believed to be helpful (496). Thumb spica splints have been widely
used for treatment of wrist compartment tendinoses while non-spica wrist splints have
been used for treatment of other compartment tendinoses (496,499,501,513,515). NSAIDs are
often prescribed for initial treatment (496). Perhaps the largest question in the management
of these conditions is how soon to inject, including whether patients might not be most
effectively treated by injection at initial clinical presentation, however, there are no quality
studies to address that question.
THUMB SPICA AND WRIST SPLINTS FOR ACUTE AND SUBACUTE THUMB EXTENSOR
COMPARTMENT TENOSYNOVITIS
Recommended
Thumb spica splints for treatment of acute and subacute thumb extensor compartment
tendinoses, and non-spica wrist splints for treatment of other extensor compartment
tendinoses are recommended.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Patients with extensor compartment tendinoses (Piligian et al., 2000)
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Generally recommended to be worn while awake.
Indications for discontinuation
Failure to respond or resolution.

Rationale
There is one moderate-quality RCT evaluating wrist splints for extensor compartment
tenosynovitis with full-time compared with PRN use and found no differences (Menendez et
al., 2015). Wrist splints are not invasive, have few adverse effects, and are not costly; thus,
they are recommended.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: Splinting, thumb

Tenosynovitis and Intersection Syndrome); controlled clinical trial, controlled trials,
randomized controlled trial, randomized controlled trials, random allocation, random*,

prospective studies. We found and reviewed 7 articles in PubMed, 3 in Scopus, 3 in CINAHL,
295 from Google Scholar, and 51 in Cochrane Library. We considered for inclusion 3 from
PubMed, 0 from Scopus, 0 from CINAHL, 0 from Cochrane Library and 2 from other sources.
Of the 359 articles considered for inclusion, 3 randomized trials and 6 systematic studies
met the inclusion criteria.

ACTIVITY MODIFICATION AND EXERCISE
MODIFICATION OF WORK ACTIVITIES FOR EXTENSOR COMPARTMENT TENOSYNOVITIS
Recommended
Removal from job tasks thought to have caused extensor compartment tenosynovitis is
recommended.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Patients with combined forceful and repeated use of the hands or combined use with
substantially non-neutral wrist postures.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution, lack of improvement, or desire of the patient to remove limitations.
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating the modification of work activities for extensor
compartment tenosynovitis. However, where occupational factors are significant, a trial of
removal from that type of work may be indicated (Pantukosit et al., 2001, Idler et al.,
1990)(Hanlon et al., 1999).

EXERCISE FOR EXTENSOR TENDON ENTRAPMENT
No Recommendation
Exercise is not generally indicated acutely and most patients with extensor tendon
entrapment do not require an exercise program. For patients with residual deficits,
particularly postoperatively, see the recommendations for carpal tunnel syndrome.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operatively, appointments should be
scheduled generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there has been functional improvements
yet there are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is
often helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week
appointments) may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe,
and there is ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g.,
increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities,
increased duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are
appropriate when there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent
objective functional gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the
therapy.
Rationale
There are no quality studies incorporated into this analysis.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following term Exercise, Physical
Activity, Extensor Compartment Tenosynovitis, De Quervain Disease, De Quervain's

prospective studies. We found, reviewed and considered for inclusion zero articles in
PubMed, zero in Scopus, 1 in CINAHL, 1 in Cochrane Library, zero in Google Scholar and zero
in other sources. Zero articles met the inclusion criteria.

MEDICATIONS
There are few quality studies on use of medications for this condition, although they are
frequently prescribed. Medications are more frequently needed compared with trigger
digits, as these conditions are typically more painful.

NSAIDS FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC EXTENSOR COMPARTMENT TENOSYNOVITIS
Recommended
NSAIDs (oral or topical) are recommended to control pain associated with acute, subacute,
or chronic extensor compartment tenosynovitides.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Patients with wrist compartment tendinoses.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Optimal dose is unknown and there are no quality studies comparing different NSAIDs.
Regularly scheduled dosing is recommended for acute, significantly symptomatic
presentations.
Indications for discontinuation
Failure to respond, development of adverse effects, resolution.
Rationale
NSAIDs are often used to treat pain associated with wrist compartment tendinoses (Piligian
et al., 2000, Pantukosit et al., 2001, Idler et al., 1990, Hanlon et al., 1999, Steinberg, 2008,
Jirarattanaphochai et al., 2004, Mazieres et al., 2005). There is one quality study
demonstrating efficacy of a ketoprofen patch versus placebo (Mazieres et al., 2005).
However, another study failed to demonstrate efficacy of injectable nimesulide as an
adjuvant treatment to triamcinolone acetonide 10mg injection (Jirarattanaphochai et al.,
2004) and another study of diclofenac gel for treating marathon kayakers prior to racing
also was negative (May et al., 2007), although applicability to occupational populations is
questionable. As an NSAID patch has been demonstrated to be efficacious compared to
placebo, it is assumed that other topical forms are also efficacious. NSAIDs are not invasive,
have low adverse effects in employed populations, and are low cost, thus they are
recommended.

ALLIED HEALTH INTERVENTIONS
IONTOPHORESIS FOR ACUTE AND SUBACUTE EXTENSOR COMPARTMENT TENOSYNOVITIS
Sometimes Recommended
Iontophoresis treatments using glucocorticosteroids and sometimes NSAIDs are
recommended for extensor compartment tenosynovitis.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Patients with wrist compartment tendinoses. Generally those who either fail to respond
adequately to NSAIDs, splints, and activity modifications or decline injection.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Generally 2 or 3 appointments to ascertain efficacy; an additional 4 to 6 appointments may
be scheduled if efficacious. If improvements continue at 6 appointments, additional 4 to 6
appointments are reasonable. Glucocorticosteroid is generally used; however, quality
studies have documented successful treatment of lateral epicondylalgia with NSAIDs
administered via iontophoresis (see Elbow Disorders Guideline); thus, they appear
reasonable for this indication as well.
Indications for discontinuation
Failure to respond, development of adverse effects, resolution.
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating iontophoresis for extensor compartment
tenosynovitis. Iontophoresis is not invasive, has low adverse effects, but is moderate to high
cost depending on the number of treatments. Iontophoresis with either a glucocorticoid or
NSAID is recommended for select patients who fail to respond to other treatments or who
decline injection.

OTHER NON-OPERATIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC EXTENSOR
COMPARTMENT TENOSYNOVITIS
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of other non-operative interventions
(e.g., manipulation and mobilization, massage, deep friction massage, or acupuncture) for
the treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic extensor compartment tenosynovitis as other
interventions have proven efficacy and are preferentially indicated for initial and
subsequent treatment options.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating other non-operative interventions for extensor
compartment tenosynovitis. Manual therapy has been attempted (Anderson et al., 1994);
however, there are no quality studies available to assess its efficacy. Deep friction massage
has been used and does not appear successful (Brosseau et al., 2002).

INJECTION THERAPIES

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

181

Glucocorticosteroid injections are frequently used for the wrist compartment tendinoses
(499,501,513,515-525)
. Techniques vary slightly (516,522) and have included attempted selective
injection of the extensor pollicis brevis tendon (526), although there are no quality studies to
compare techniques. Estimates of efficacy in case series and active treatment arms of trials
range from 54-100% (516,521,522,526-530).
GLUCOCORTICOSTEROID INJECTIONS FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC DE
QUERVAIN’S OR OTHER WRIST COMPARTMENT TENDINOSIS
Recommended
Glucocorticosteroid injections are recommended for treatment of acute, subacute, or
chronic de Quervain’s or other wrist compartment tendinosis.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence High
Indications
Wrist compartment symptoms of pain over a compartment. Generally at least 1 week of
non-invasive treatment to determine if condition will resolve without invasive treatment. It
is reasonable to treat cases with an initial injection although there is no quality evidence to
support that approach. Failure or suboptimal results with an initial injection result in a need
for additional injection(s) in a minority of patients that is (are) usually successful (PetersVeluthamaningal et al., 2009, Anderson et al., 1991, Sakai, 2002).
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Optimal dose is unknown. Studies have utilized methylprednisolone acetate 40mg (Goldfarb
et al., 2007, Anderson et al., 1991, Witt et al., 1991) and triamcinolone acetonide 10mg
(Peters-Veluthamaningal et al., 2009, Sakai, 2002). An adjuvant injectable anesthetic is
typically used (Jirarattanaphochai et al., 2004, Anderson et al., 1991, Sakai, 2002). Some
clinicians splint the wrist afterwards, however, there is no quality evidence this improves
efficacy or duration of benefits. Two low-quality studies suggest no greater efficacy with
splinting; however, greater costs and lost time were incurred (Kosuwon, 1996, Weiss et al.,
1994).

It is recommended that a single injection be scheduled and the results evaluated to
document improvement (Peters-Veluthamaningal et al., 2009). Failure of a response within
1 or 2 weeks should result in reanalysis of the diagnosis and consideration of repeat
injection (Peters-Veluthamaningal et al., 2009). Recurrence of symptoms months later
should result in consideration of re-injection (Lapidus et al., 1972, Anderson et al., 1991).
There is no maximum number of injections to treat an episode or over a lifetime
demonstrated in quality studies. Therapeutic injection failures are reportedly strongly
associated with the presence of a separate compartment for the extensor pollicis brevis
tendon in 73% of cases (Witt et al., 1991).

182

Indications for discontinuation
If a partial response, consideration should be given to repeating the injection, typically at a
modestly higher dose.
Rationale
There is 1 moderate-quality study comparing glucocorticosteroid injections with placebo for
treatment of de Quervain’s stenosing tenosynovitis (Peters-Veluthamaningal et al., 2009).
The trial showed considerable benefits from active treatment that persisted for 12 months
and allows for an evidence-based recommendation. One trial found steroid injection
superior to acupuncture (Hadianfard et al., 2014). Ultrasound-guidance has been suggested
to be moderately superior (Kume et al., 2012). Two trials have found inconclusive evidence
regarding whether splint use is required in addition to steroid injection (Mardani-Kivi et al.,
2014, Mehdinasab et al., 2010) A high-quality trial found the steroid flare was unrelated to
pH (Goldfarb et al., 2007); however, there was no placebo control group. Another highquality trial found no additive benefit of NSAID in addition to injection to prevent
recurrence, but it did not assess reductions in pain immediately after injection; thus, it
appears to have no bearing on use of NSAIDs for those purposes (Jirarattanaphochai et al.,
2004). A low-quality trial found glucocorticosteroid injection superior to splinting in
pregnant and lactating females (Avci et al., 2002).
These injections are minimally invasive, have low adverse effects, and are moderately
costly; thus, they are recommended to treat de Quervain’s or other wrist compartment
tendinosis.

SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
SURGICAL RELEASE FOR SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC EXTENSOR COMPARTMENT
TENOSYNOVITIS
Recommended
Surgical release is recommended for patients with subacute or chronic extensor
compartment tenosynovitis who fail to respond to injection.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
A confirmed diagnosis of de Quervain syndrome/first dorsal wrist compartment
tenosynovitis requires a positive Finkelstein's maneuver plus at least three of the following:
●
pain that is focal over the first extensor tendon compartment,
●
worsening pain in the first extensor compartment with movement of the thumb
and/or wrist,
●
tenderness over the first extensor compartment, (4) snapping or catching sensation
when moving the thumb, and
●
swelling over the first extensor tendon compartment.
Surgical considerations include both of the following:
●
failure of at least two nonoperative treatments (i.e., activity modification, thumb
spica splinting, anti-inflammatory medications, at least two to three iontophoresis
treatments using glucocorticosteroids) and
●
one glucocorticosteroid injection for which there is documented short-term
improvement in symptoms (unless there is a documented contraindication for an injection)
(Lapidus et al., 1972)
Indications for other extensor compartment tenosynovitides are analogous.
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating the use of surgical release for extensor compartment
tenosynovitis (Servi et al., 1997, Williams, 1977). While surgery release is invasive, has
moderate adverse effects, and is costly, it is usually clinically effective and recommended for
patients who have failed glucocorticosteroid injection(s) and other noninvasive treatments.

FLEXOR TENDON ENTRAPMENT
OVERVIEW
Stenosing tenosynovitis is a generally non-inflammatory condition caused by hypertrophy of
the A-1 pulley with ensuing narrowing of the canal through which the digital flexors travel,
with resulting symptoms of pain and snapping of the digit particularly with extension of a
flexed digit (531-536). While some cases are thought to be occupational (26) and many cases
have been reportedly idiopathic, there are other less frequent reported causes and
associated conditions, including diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, CTS, Dupuytren’s
disease, osteoarthrosis, amyloidosis, hypothyroidism, heredity, and partial tendon
laceration (537-542). There also is evidence these may be connective tissue disorders (543,544).
Diabetes mellitus reportedly portends a worse prognosis for glucocorticosteroid injection
(545,546)
.
The disorder includes a spectrum from localized pain in the flexor compartment to
triggering to locking of a digit (547). The most common abnormality is thickening at or of the
A1 pulley (547). Less common pathophysiologic abnormalities include metacarpal-phalangeal
joint abnormalities, disorders at the level of the carpal tunnel, and other pulley anomalies
(547)
.
Flexor tendon entrapment generally presents as a relatively simple clinical presentation.
Some occur after acute injury, but most occur without specific inciting event (547-551).
Symptoms are variable and may include pain, stiffness, clicking, snapping, and locking
(536,542,550,552-557)
. Pain is generally in the volar digit and/or metacarpophalangeal joint area
(553-556)
. Certain patients report worse symptoms in the morning or after lack of use (547).
Patients without triggering will typically have tenderness localized over the A1 pulley (558). A
palpable tendon nodule is frequently present. Triggering often occurs upon arising in the
morning or after lack of use. Active movement is often required to demonstrate triggering
as passive motion is often normal. Those rare cases with a locked digit are unable to extend
(or flex) the digit (10,506,538,540-542,547-550,557,559-576).
Follow-up visits are generally limited unless complications arise. Success of injections is
usually high, thus 1 or 2 follow-up appointments are typical. Post-surgical outcomes for
minimally invasive approaches are similarly excellent and necessitate few, if any follow-up
appointments beyond 1 or 2. Additional appointments are required for complicated
courses.
Whether work limitations are indicated or helpful is unknown, but may be reasonable for
select cases, particularly where contributions from physical factors are more probable such
as localized compression from sharp objects or tools.
As the epidemiological evidence is weak, the etiological fraction for occupational tasks is
unknown (544). Thus, work-relatedness is somewhat unclear (19). The available biomechanical
evidence suggests pinch force may be a risk factor (542,547,548,550,552,553,559,560,577,578-584). The
mechanism of injury for many appears to be typically idiopathic (547,548,550,585) or as a
Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

185

complication of medical conditions (especially diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis)
(540)
. However, available epidemiological and biomechanical evidence suggests that the
disorder may also occur as a complication of repeated forceful use of a digit (542,547550,552,553,559,560,577-583)
, or unaccustomed use (542,547), thus many cases may be work-related
(26,547,584)
. A careful history of occupational tasks as well as non-occupational exposures is
recommended.

The diagnosis of flexor tendon entrapment is clinical. Patients without triggering will
typically have only focal A1 pulley tenderness with or without a tendon nodule. Patients
with triggering can usually demonstrate the triggering for the examiner.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES FOR FLEXOR TENDON ENTRAPMENT
No Recommendation
There are no special tests that are typically performed for flexor tendon entrapment. X-rays
are usually not helpful. The threshold for testing for confounding conditions such as
diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and connective tissue disorders should be low,
particularly to prevent other morbidity (Saldana, 2001, Moore, 2000).

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
EXERCISE
EXERCISE FOR FLEXOR TENDON ENTRAPMENT
No Recommendation
Exercise is not generally indicated acutely and most patients with flexor tendon entrapment
do not require an exercise program. For patients with residual deficits, particularly
postoperatively, see the recommendations for carpal tunnel syndrome.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operatively, appointments should be
scheduled generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there has been functional improvements
yet there are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is
often helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week
appointments) may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe,
and there is ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g.,
increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities,
increased duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are
appropriate when there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent
objective functional gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the
therapy.

MEDICATIONS
MEDICATIONS FOR FLEXOR TENDON ENTRAPMENT
No Recommendation
Medications are generally not required for flexor tendon entrapment because the condition
is generally not substantially painful. There are no quality studies on use of medications for
flexor tendon entrapment, although some studies have recommended NSAIDs (Saldana,
2001). NSAIDs may be a reasonable option to control pain; however, injections appear to be
superior interventions. NSAIDs may be a more appropriate intervention for those who
decline initial injection.

DEVICES
SPLINTS FOR SELECT CASES OF ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC FLEXOR TENDON
ENTRAPMENT

of acute, subacute, or chronic flexor tendon entrapment.

There is one moderate-quality RCT evaluating the use of two different splints for flexor
tendon entrapment with no apparent differences in outcomes between the types of splints
(Tarbhai et al., 2012). Historically splints were widely used for treatment of trigger digits
(Ryzewicz et al., 2006, Saldana, 2001, Moore, 2000, Akhtar et al., 2005, Colbourn et al.,
2008); however, prior to the advent of glucocorticosteroid injection, the lack of successful
treatments often resulted in surgery. Splints have been used to treat trigger digits (Ryzewicz
et al., 2006, Saldana, 2001) and they may be reasonable intervention for patients who
decline injection, although it is recommended that patients be educated that the use of
splints appears substantially less successful than injections (or surgery).

INJECTION THERAPIES
GLUCOCORTICOSTEROID INJECTIONS FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC FLEXOR
TENDON ENTRAPMENT
Recommended
Glucocorticosteroid injections are strongly recommended for treatment of acute, subacute,
or chronic flexor tendon entrapment.
Strength of evidence Strongly Recommended, Evidence (A)
Level of confidence High
Indications
Triggering digit or symptoms of pain over the A-1 pulley thought to be consistent with
stenosing tenosynovitis. Injection at the first appointment may be the most appropriate
initial intervention (Nimigan et al., 2006).
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Optimal dose is unknown. Quality studies have included betamethasone 6mg (Baumgarten
et al., 2007, Warren et al., 1988), depot preparation of methylprednisolone 20mg (Hong,
2005); and triamcinolone 1mL (Smit et al., 2010) most of which were generally combined
with an anesthetic. However, there are no quality comparisons of doses and the need for
topical anesthetic is untested in quality studies. Subcutaneous injection over the A-1 pulley

189

appears as efficacious as attempted intrasheath injection (Betts-Symonds et al., 1982). A
single injection and results evaluated to document improvement. Ultrasound-guidance is
not shown to be helpful (Goldfarb et al., 2007, Cecen et al., 2015).
Indications for discontinuation
If a partial response, consideration should be given to repeating the injection, typically at a
modestly higher dose.
Rationale
There are 2 high-quality and 2 moderate-quality studies incorporated into this analysis
(Baumgarten et al., 2007, Akhtar et al., 2006, Benson et al., 1997, Clark et al., 1973).
Glucocorticosteroid injection(s) are the most commonly used intervention for trigger digits
(Nimigan et al., 2006, Moore, 2000). Quality studies have reviewed attempts to inject along
the tendon, although a moderate-quality study failed to find superior results among the
group with an attempt to inject within the sheath (Fleisch et al., 2007) and a low-quality
study performed subcutaneous injections that were efficacious (Marks et al., 1989). Further,
ultrasound guidance has not been found to improve the results (Cecen et al., 2015). It has
been suggested that many injections are performed along, rather than within the sheaths
(Newport et al., 1990) and thus it may not matter how precisely these injections
approximate the target tissue. Multiple studies have consistently demonstrated efficacy of
these injections compared with placebo with estimates of success typically exceeding 80%
(Rhoades et al., 1984, Baumgarten et al., 2007, Akhtar et al., 2006, Benson et al., 1997, Clark
et al., 1973, Sato et al., 2012, Zyluk et al., 2011, Callegari et al., 2011, Pataradool et al., 2011,
Ring et al., 2008, Shakeel et al., 2012, Taras et al., 1998, Cecen et al., 2015, Jianmongkol et
al., 2007). Two studies compared injection with surgery, but the recurrence rates while
lower with surgery still showed strong efficacy of injection (0% vs. 11% recurrence
(Jianmongkol et al., 2007) and 0% vs. 14% (Cecen et al., 2015)). They are less effective in
diabetics, although still are effective (Baumgarten et al., 2007) and there is weak evidence
that patients failing other medical treatments may respond at lower rates of approximately
60% (Anderson et al., 1991). These injections are minimally invasive, have low adverse
effects, and are moderate cost. Some caution is warranted regarding repeated
administrations with adverse effects including atrophy that generally recovers over time.
Nevertheless, quality studies have documented their efficacy and thus, they are strongly
recommended.

SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
SURGERY FOR PERSISTENT OR CHRONIC FLEXOR TENDON ENTRAPMENT
Recommended
Open release for persistent or chronic flexor tendon entrapment is moderately
recommended. Percutaneous release is also a reasonable option (Kamhin et al., 1983).
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence High
Indications
A confirmed diagnosis of trigger digit/flexor tendon entrapment/flexor tenosynovitis
requires either:
●
tenderness over the A-1 pulley and/or volar metacarpophalangeal joint area or
●
locking/triggering of the digit.
Patients should have either:
●
failed one glucocorticosteroid injection for which there is documented immediate
improvement in symptoms (absent a contraindication for an injection) or
●
the digit locks requiring manipulation to open or extend the digit.
Those without any response to an injection should be evaluated carefully for possible
alternate conditions.
If there was no documented immediate improvement in symptoms after an injection, a
second injection is recommended.
Adjunctive surgical treatment with glucocorticosteroid injection could be considered,
although that evidence relies on a single moderate-quality study (Akhtar et al., 2006).
Rationale
Both open (with a scalpel) and percutaneous (with a needle through the skin) releases are
performed with evidence both are effective (Topper et al., 1997). Evidence is strong that
percutaneous release is as effective, if not more effective than as open release (Eastwood et
al., 1992, Cecen et al., 2015, Jianmongkol et al., 2007, Gilberts et al., 2001,
Bamroongshawgasame, 2010, Fu et al., 2006, Yiannakopoulos et al., 2006, Chao et al., 2009,
Pegoli et al., 2008, Costa et al., 2003, de Lima et al., 2004), is faster to perform, requires
fewer resources (Bamroongshawgasame, 2010, Costa et al., 2003), involves less pain, and
results in faster recovery (Bamroongshawgasame, 2010). Failures are believed to be due to
incomplete release of the A-1 pulley (Lee et al., 2009). There are concerns, however, that
particularly in inexperienced hands, lacerations of digital nerves, arteries, and other
structures and other complications have been reported with the percutaneous technique.
The thumb appears more prone to these complications. A moderate-quality study

attempted to identify which third of the pulley was responsible for triggering; however,
failures occurred in all surgical groups regardless of which third of the pulley was released
(Lee et al., 2009). A low-quality case series suggested repeat percutaneous release was
reasonable for treatment of incomplete releases (Chien et al., 2001), although open release
has been favored for percutaneous failures. One moderate-quality study compared
injections with percutaneous release combined with glucocorticosteroid injection and
reported surgical release was superior (Cebesoy et al., 2007), although the success rates
were both lower than other reports. Surgical release is invasive (though less invasive with
percutaneous release) (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2015), has low adverse effects, but is costly. For
those patients failing glucocorticosteroid injection(s), surgery is recommended.

FRACTURES
FRACTURE CLASSIFICATION
Several classification systems for distal radial fractures have been developed in an effort to
evaluate treatment outcomes. However, studies of interobserver reliability and
intraobserver reproducibility for the better-known classification systems (such as Frykman,
Melone, Mayo, AO, and Fernandez) have demonstrated unsatisfactory reliability and
reproducibility (586,587). Therefore, the key to recommending a treatment course is to
determine the following criteria: is a fracture open or closed, stable or unstable, or likely to
become unstable. Treatment can then be provided based on these criteria until better
information is available to compare outcomes using a classification system that is reliable
and reproducible.
In describing or in considering a specific treatment course of distal radial fractures, it may be
more useful to determine the stability of fracture patterns according to radiological
measurements rather than a specific classification system (588). Stable fractures are most
often defined as dorsal angulation of less than 10°, radial shortening of 2mm maximum, and
no radial shift (589). Fractures outside of these limits generally require reduction, with larger
angulation, articulation step-offs, dorsal comminution, and lateral shift of more than 2mm
considered contributory factors for fracture instability and indication for more aggressive
therapies (590,591). Despite the importance placed on these criteria, not surprisingly there are
conflicting opinions regarding the reliability of these measurements, which provides
reduced confidence that these are absolute criteria, and leads to some uncertainty

192

regarding measurements used in comparison studies as well as in general practice
(592,593,594,595)
.
In cases where there is hardware placed, subsequent hardware removal is indicated in cases
of: (1) protruding hardware, (2) pain attributed to the hardware, (3) broken hardware on
imaging, and/or (4) positive anesthetic injection response.

DISTAL FOREARM FRACTURES
OVERVIEW
Fractures of the distal forearm make up a significant proportion of injuries and fractures
treated in the emergency room (596), although no quality data regarding incidence or injury
type in the workplace were found. Fractures may or may not be occupational, but most
distal forearm fractures are not work-related. There are several types of distal forearm
fractures in adults, the most common being Colles’ fracture, named after the surgeon and
anatomist Dr. Abraham Colles who described it in 1814 (597,598). Because it is the most
common, the eponym Colles’ fracture is often mistakenly used as a generic reference term
for all forearm or wrist fractures in adult populations. However, Colles’ fracture specifically
refers to a transverse fracture of the distal radial metaphysis, with or without extension into
and disruption of the radiocarpal or radioulnar articular surfaces. The distinguishing feature
for Colles’ fracture is that fracture fragments are displaced or angulated dorsally on a
lateral view x-ray. Other adult distal radial fractures include displaced fracture fragments
that have an anterior angulation and displaced fracture fragments that are displaced
palmarly and may have an anterior angulation. A fracture of the distal radius with carpal
displacement can be dorsal or palmar displaced, the latter being more common. That type
of fracture is caused by a fall on an extended and pronated wrist increasing carpal
compression force on the dorsal rim. Some fractures are limited to the radial styloid and
some are frequently associated with fracture of the ulnar styloid (597,599,600), as well as a high
incidence of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) disruption (601). In one report of 118
distal fracture cases, TFCC tears occurred in 53% of extra-articular distal radius fractures and
35% of intra-articular fractures (602). Failure to recognize a torn TFCC may result in
inadequate immobilization or surgical repair, resulting in distal radioulnar joint instability.
Despite the severity of these injuries, with proper diagnosis and management most patients
will have a satisfactory outcome (603).
Wrist injuries associated with significant pain, swelling, ecchymosis, crepitance, or deformity
should be considered to be fractured until proven otherwise. Forearm fractures may also
result in concomitant vascular, neurological, ligament and tendon injuries. Further, as distal
forearm fractures are the result of trauma, careful inspection for other traumatic injuries
should be included, such as elbow, shoulder, neck, head, and hip. In general, most distal
forearm fractures should be managed by an orthopedic or hand surgeon and consultation is
recommended.
Comprehensive physical examination for traumatic injuries at the wrist as well as elbow,
shoulder, neck, head, and hip should be included. Examination of the injured wrist and hand
should include neurological and vascular exam, as well as testing for tendon and ligament
integrity. The ulnar styloid should be palpated for tenderness as well as the radial head.

193

TFCC should be suspected for displaced or complex fractures, and DRUJ instability may be
noted dependent on extent of pain and nature of fracture.
Distal radial fractures are the result of traumatic forces, most commonly related to falling on
the outstretched hand. The typical mechanism for Colles’ fracture is breaking the fall with
the hand outstretched and wrist in dorsiflexion, although a minority occur due to an impact
on the dorsal aspect of the hand while the wrist is flexed (jam injury into the dorsum of
hand) or a direct blow to the radial stylus (597,599,600). In modern times, this injury more often
results from a fall with the hand in ulnar deviation and midway between pronation and
supination, or as a result of other force that is transferred axially from the scaphoid into the
radial facet. Distal radial fractures are up to 6 times more common in women, with
incidence of 7. 3 vs. 1. 7 per 1,000 human years (604). In addition, people who walk regularly,
which increases exposure to falling, have an associated higher incidence of fractures.
Osteoporosis and low bone-mineral density is also an associated risk factor for fracture (605),
and likely explains much of higher incidence of fracture in women. A large population
longitudinal study of osteoporosis has shown elderly women with high risk factors such as
diabetes mellitus, cognitive impairment, and history of falls are at high risk for fall and distal
forearm fracture, and should be considered for selective preventive strategies to reduce the
incidence of these fractures (606).
The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) plays a somewhat analogous role in the wrist to
the meniscus and collateral ligaments in the knee. It is formed by a network of ligaments
and articular cartilage originating on the medial border of the distal radius with insertion
into the base of the ulnar styloid, and includes a meniscus at the distal radioulnar joint
(DRUJ). The TFCC plays an important role in load bearing across the wrist as well as in DRUJ
stabilization (607), and in allowing for pronation and supination of the hand (608). In cases
where there is hardware placed, subsequent hardware removal is indicated in cases of: (1)
protruding hardware, (2) pain attributed to the hardware, (3) broken hardware on imaging,
and/or (4) positive anesthetic injection response.
Functional restrictions of the affected extremity are limited by immobilization technique.
Activities should be modified to allow for splinting and immobilization of the forearm.
Return to work will likely be influenced by the patient and clinician's subjective assessment
of disability and perception of job difficulty. It may be helpful to refer the patient to an
occupational therapist to address the appropriate activity modification, compensatory
strategies, adaptive equipment, and environmental modification throughout the period of
the patient’s recovery and rehabilitation.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
X-RAY FOR SUSPECTED DISTAL FOREARM FRACTURES
Recommended
X-rays in the posterior-anterior and lateral views are recommended as a first-line study for
suspected distal forearm fractures.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Rationale

194

There is no quality evidence for evaluation of x-ray studies for evaluation of suspected distal
radial fractures. However, x-ray studies are standard of practice for suspected fracture.
Therefore, as a first-line study, PA, lateral and if available oblique x-ray image views are
recommended. Radiographic evaluation should provide the clinician necessary information
on location, configuration, displacement, subluxation, likelihood of stability, and
concomitant potential of soft tissue injury. Contralateral wrist x-ray images should be
considered as a comparison that may improve reliability of some radiographic
measurements, particularly for a more accurate determination of stability and provide
greater guidance on indication for treatment.

MRI FOR DIAGNOSING DISTAL FOREARM FRACTURES
Recommended
MRI is recommended to diagnose suspected soft-tissue trauma after x-ray images confirm a
complex displaced, unstable, or comminuted distal forearm fractures.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There is no quality evidence that MRI is superior to radiographs for the initial detection of
distal radial fractures and should not be generally used as a first line test. Upon confirmation
of displaced, comminuted or unstable fracture, MRI may be an important diagnostic
technique for the evaluation of suspected injuries of soft tissues related to distal radius
fractures, such as to the flexor and extensor tendons or the median nerve. Other potential
indications include identification of triangular fibrocartilage complex perforations, ruptures
of carpal ligaments, and demonstration of contents of the carpal tunnel (Bombaci et al.,
2008, Metz et al., 1993, Spence et al., 1998).

CT FOR DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION OF OCCULT AND COMPLEX DISTAL FOREARM
FRACTURES
Recommended
CT is recommended for investigation of occult and complex distal forearm fractures to gain
greater clarity of fracture displacement, articular involvement, and subluxation of the distal
radioulnar joint (Harness et al., 2006).
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Negative x-rays with occult fracture strongly suspected.
Rationale
In contrast to MRI, CT should be considered when x-ray images are negative but on the basis
of physical findings an occult fracture is strongly suspected. CT may also be useful for
evaluation of complex comminuted fractures, providing superior depiction of distal radial
articular surface involvement, fragment positioning, and diagnosis of subluxations of the
distal radioulnar joint (Harness et al., 2006, Catalano et al., 2004). The value of CT has been
demonstrated by Katz et al, who showed the use of CT scanning for evaluation of articular
step off and gaping, comminution, and treatment influenced observers to change treatment
plans developed from radiographs and resulted in increased interobserver reliability in the
proposed management of these injuries (Katz et al., 2001).

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
INITIAL CARE
IMMOBILIZATION PERIOD OF THREE OR LESS WEEKS (EARLY MOBILIZATION) FOR NONDISPLACED OR MINIMALLY DISPLACED DISTAL RADIUS FRACTURES
Recommended
Immobilization of non-displaced or minimally displaced distal forearm fractures limited to 3
weeks is moderately recommended and has equivalent or superior functional outcomes
than periods greater than 3 weeks for non-displaced or minimally displaced distal radius
fracture.
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
Six moderate-quality studies (Christensen et al., 1995, Davis et al., 1987, Dias et al., 1987,
McAuliffe et al., 1987, Millett et al., 1995, Vang Hansen et al., 1998) support limiting
immobilization of non-displaced or minimally displaced non-articular fractures of the distal
radius to a period of 3 weeks or less. The clinical definition of minimally displaced fractures,
however, is not established by quality evidence, as the available literature lacks a consistent
standardized fracture classification, such as Frykman’s or the AO classification systems. In
general, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for entry into interventional studies reviewed in
this Guideline may act as a defacto guideline, defining minimally displaced as fractures with
less than 10° of dorsal angulation, less than 10° of radial angulation, and less than 2 to 3mm
of radial shortening (Davis et al., 1987, Earnshaw et al., 2002, Lagerstrom et al., 1999,
Lagerstrom et al., 1999, Stoffelen et al., 1998).
In each study comparing immobilization of 3 or 5 weeks, patients demonstrated either
improved functional measures such as pain scores (Davis et al., 1987), wrist swelling, wrist
and grip strength, and better subjective patient assessments with shorter immobilization
periods, or no measurable differences between the groups indicating there is no advantage
to longer immobilization periods. There were no differences in radiographic findings in any
of the studies associated with duration of immobilization (Christensen et al., 1995, Dias et
al., 1987) There is no quality evidence supporting immobilization for periods greater than 3
weeks in these cases. Although there is one low-quality study that suggests equivalent
functional results are achieved with fewer cases of complex regional pain syndrome (1 vs. 5)
(Stoffelen et al., 1998), there is insufficient evidence to support 1-week immobilization.

The use of functional bracing or splinting that will allow mobilization of the radial-carpal
joint while maintaining stabilization of the fracture is moderately recommended over
traditional casting to immobilize the forearm and wrist for non-displaced or minimally
displaced Colles’ fractures.
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are multiple moderate-quality studies providing moderate evidence in support of
functional bracing or splinting over traditional casting for non-displaced or minimally
displaced fractures of the distal radius (Davis et al., 1987, Dias et al., 1987, Abbaszadegan et
al., 1989, Ledingham et al., 1991, Moir et al., 1995, O'Connor et al., 2003). Functional
bracing or splinting techniques described allow for mobilization at the radiocarpal joint.
Various splinting techniques have been described, including the use of the lightweight
removable splints (O'Connor et al., 2003), posterior splint with tubigrip (Davis et al., 1987),
crépe bandage (Dias et al., 1987), elastic bandage (Abbaszadegan et al., 1989), triple point
loading brace with adjustable Velcro straps (Moir et al., 1995), and 3-point loading
functional plaster brace (Ledingham et al., 1991).
As there are no direct comparisons between types of functional bracing, no specific
recommendation can be made as to which if any technique is superior. The importance of
early radiocarpal joint mobilization appears to be most important factor. Improved
functional outcome through early mobilization may be a surrogate or confounder to the
recommendation for shorter durations (3-week period) of immobilization, which essentially
achieves the same objective of reducing immobilization of the radiocarpal joint. The
literature is unclear if there might be an additive effect for functional bracing combined with
immobilization of the fracture for 3 weeks or less, as functional bracing was compared to
traditional casting of 4 to 6 weeks duration.

CASTING/BRACING NON-DISPLACED OR MINIMALLY DISPLACED COLLES’ FRACTURES IN
PRONATION OR SUPINATION
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against casting/bracing the forearm and wrist in
pronation or supination for non-displaced or minimally displaced Colles’ fractures.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are two moderate-quality studies on cast positioning of the forearm and hand, either
supination or pronation, and functional outcomes. One study found no advantage to
supination over conventional Colles’ casting (Stewart et al., 1984); the other found forearm
casting in pronation superior to above-elbow supination (Wilson et al., 1984). As both
techniques were last reported on more than 20 years ago, and with more recent evidence
indicating that functional splinting is more effective casting, no recommendation is made
regarding casting in pronation or supination in patients with non-displaced Colles’ fractures,
although pronation is likely superior to supination if casting is attempted. Casting the
forearm and wrist in pronation may provide benefit over casting in supination, although
neither is recommended if functional bracing or splinting is an available treatment option.

MEDICATIONS
NSAIDS FOR ACUTE COLLES’ FRACTURE (DISTAL FOREARM FRACTURE) ANALGESIA
Recommended
The use of NSAIDs to control bone pain associated with Colles’ fracture is recommended as
there does not appear to be any negative effect on bone fracture union or functional
recovery.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Bone pain associated with Colles’ fracture.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Scheduled dosage rather than as needed is generally preferable.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution of pain, lack of efficacy, development of adverse effects, particularly
gastrointestinal.
Rationale
There are three moderate-quality studies that show NSAIDs are effective for pain relief of
distal forearm fracture (Adolphson et al., 1993, Barrington, 1980, Davis et al., 1988).
Flurbiprofen was more effective than placebo in conjunction with bier block manipulation
and for post manipulation pain (Davis et al., 1988). Piroxicam was more effective than
paracetamol (Adolphson et al., 1993), and diflunisal was equally effective as mefenamic
acid. No changes in Gartland and Werley functional assessment scores (Davis et al., 1988) or
functional recovery in postmenopausal women (Adolphson et al., 1993) were found,
indicating there is no significant benefit other than pain relief from the use of NSAIDS.

PHYSICAL METHODS/REHABILITATION
USE OF LOW-FREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS TO STIMULATE BONE HEALING OF
DISTAL RADIAL FRACTURES
Not Recommended
The use of extremely low frequency (1-1000 Hz) electromagnetic field therapy to stimulate
bone healing in patients with non-displaced fractures is not recommended.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There is one moderate-quality study of extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic field
(EMF) therapy, which is hypothesized to stimulate bone healing as measured by
scintigraphy. The study found early increased bone activity in the first two weeks vs. control,
but the differences disappeared after Week 2. In a subset of patients with displaced
fractures that were re-displaced during the study, EMF of ELF resulted in higher scintimetric
scores; however, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown (Wahlstrom, 1984).

EDUCATION AFTER CAST REMOVAL FOR ACUTE COLLES’ FRACTURE
Recommended
Referral of select patients needing education after cast removal for acute Colles’ fracture is
recommended.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
A few appointments for educational purposes for select patients are recommended. The
numbers of appointments are dependent on the degree of debility, with one or 2
educational appointments appropriate for mildly affected patients. Patients with severe
debility or those unable to return to work may necessitate 8 to 12 appointments that
particularly emphasize progressive strengthening exercises. Additionally, while routine use
may be of limited benefit, those patients who have muscle weakness or other debilities may
also derive benefit from therapy including self-training exercises, particularly if unable to
return to work. Therefore, occupational or physical therapy is recommended for select
patients.

In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operative, appointments should be scheduled
generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there has been functional improvements yet there
are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is often
helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week appointments)
may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe, and there is
ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits. Additional sets of
5-6 appointments are appropriate when there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but
are not advised absent objective functional gain. Home exercises should be performed in
conjunction with the therapy.
Indications for discontinuation
There are two moderate-quality studies on the effects of physical or occupational therapy to
hasten functional recovery once the cast is removed in non-surgical patients. One study,
despite lack of blinding in the control group and small sample size, showed no added benefit
to the addition of occupational therapy to home exercise instructions by the clinician. This
finding was consistent regardless of fracture angulation and functional scores (Christensen
et al., 2001). Conversely, in another study also weakened by small sample size and lack of
blinding, physical therapy (passive joint mobilization) was found more effective than no
therapy in increasing wrist extension and grip strength in the immediate cast removal
period. However, there were no long-term measures to determine the duration of benefit in
the intervention group (Watt et al., 2000). One low-quality study (Pasila et al., 1974) and
one case series (Oskarsson, 1997) also found no functional benefit for physical therapy.
A few appointments for educational purposes for select patients are recommended. The

SURGERY
CLOSED REDUCTION OR EXTERNAL FIXATION FOR SEVERELY DISPLACED EXTRA-ARTICULAR
FRACTURES, COMMINUTED, OR DISPLACED INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES OF THE DISTAL
FOREARM
Recommended
Closed reduction or external fixation is moderately recommended for treatment of severely
displaced extra-articular fractures, and for comminuted, displaced intra-articular fractures
of the distal forearm.
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence High
Rationale
Most comparative studies for surgical intervention of distal radial fractures includes external
fixation using various named external fixators. In consideration of the topic, all studies using
external fixators are considered as one particular treatment group, as few comparisons are
made between individual types or brands of fixators. There are several moderate-quality
studies available for this treatment. Overall, the available data is weakened by studies with
small sample sizes, a lack of consistency in fracture types included in each study, and
inconsistency in reported final outcomes measures (i.e., functional, radiographic) and
duration of follow-up. Extra-articular fractures or distal forearm fractures that include nondisplaced intra-articular fractures can be treated initially with external immobilization, using
external fixation as a second option for fractures that fail reduction while immobilized.
External fixation likely does not provide improved functional results in the elderly.
In consideration of support for external fixation, 5 moderate-quality studies that included
either mixed fracture types or were limited to extra-articular, non comminuted and nondisplaced intra-articular fracture types, generally showed equivocal or non-statistically
significant positive trends in radiographic or functional outcomes when compared with
casting (Pring et al., 1988, Young et al., 2003, Kreder et al., 2006, McQueen et al., 1996,
Merchan et al., 1992). Another moderate-quality study compared plaster cast to external
fixation and found that patients with plaster casts showed significantly higher Maximum
Voluntary Contraction than patients with primary external fixation on day immobilization
device was removed until between 18 weeks and 1 year when the groups equalized
(Lagerstrom et al., 1999). Therefore, there is evidence supporting non-operative treatment
for these fractures using non-invasive immobilization techniques. However, for the more
severe fractures, including comminuted extra-articular and displaced comminuted intraarticular types, there are 6 moderate-quality studies that support improved clinical
outcomes from external fixation over casting (Howard et al., 1989, Jenkins et al., 1988,
Jenkins et al., 1987, Kapoor et al., 2000, Stein et al., 1990, Abbaszadegan et al., 1990). Thus,
there is strong evidence to support more invasive immobilization techniques for these more
severe injuries. One exception to this may be for those over age 65, as there is one
moderate-quality study that showed no difference in functional outcomes despite worse
anatomical outcomes, suggesting the final anatomical outcome is less important in this age

group (Roumen et al., 1991). As there is only one study supporting this, there is insufficient
evidence to make recommendations for or against greater emphasis on non-operative
treatment in older populations.
Two moderate-quality comparison studies of external fixation with medullary pinning
(percutaneous) resulted in mostly equivocal studies for radiographic and clinical outcomes
measures (Ludvigsen et al., 1997, Pritchett, 1995), although both authors felt there were
financial and post-operative care advantages with pinning over external fixation. One
moderate-quality study, weakened by co-intervention differences, demonstrated improved
outcomes with combined external fixation and additional k-wire fixation for displaced intraarticular fractures (Kapoor et al., 2000). If pinning is selected, there does not seem to be any
difference in technique comparing Kapandji and Willinegger procedures (Strohm et al.,
2004), nor in the length of post-operative cast immobilization comparing 1 vs. 6 weeks
(Allain et al., 1999). An alternative method for the treatment of distal radial fracture
includes the use of bone cement. There are five moderate-quality studies found, although
one author reported on the same study population in two different papers. The injection of
remodellable bone cement, or the open reduction and use of remodellable bone cement,
was shown to provide improved anatomic and functional outcomes compared to casting
(Sanchez-Sotelo et al., 2000, Schmalholz, 1989) and external fixation (Kopylov et al., 1999,
Schmalholz, 1990) and reducing immobilization time (Kopylov et al., 2001). There is only one
moderate-quality study on the repair of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) with distal
radial fractures (Ekenstam et al., 1989). In a small sample size study limited to Frykman II
and VI, closed reduction and casting had equivocal results to surgical repair. However, this
study was published in 1989, prior to more recent anatomic studies and case series reports
on TFCC. Therefore, no recommendation is made for TFCC repair based on insufficient
evidence.
There is no quality evidence for specific internal fixation techniques in comparison to
external fixation or other immobilization techniques. However, there is one moderatequality study of two internal fixation techniques, which recommends against the use of piplates, which were more difficult to match properly to distal radius, and resulted in worse
wrist flexion and extension outcomes than from ¼ tube plates (Hahnloser et al., 1999). Thus,
with insufficient evidence for comparison, there are no recommendations for internal
fixation techniques.

anatomical outcomes, suggesting the final anatomical outcome is less important in this age
group (Roumen et al., 1991). As there is only one study supporting this, there is insufficient
evidence to make recommendation for or against greater emphasis on non-operative
treatment in older populations. Two moderate-quality comparison studies of external
fixation with medullary pinning (percutaneous) resulted in mostly equivocal studies for
radiographic and clinical outcomes measures (Ludvigsen et al., 1997, Pritchett, 1995),

pinning over external fixation. One moderate-quality study, weakened by co-intervention
differences, demonstrated improved outcomes with combined external fixation and
additional k-wire fixation for displaced intra-articular fractures (Kapoor et al., 2000). If
pinning is selected, there does not seem to be any difference in technique comparing
Kapandji and Willinegger procedures (Strohm et al., 2004), nor in the length of postoperative cast immobilization comparing 1 vs. 6 weeks (Allain et al., 1999). An alternative
method for the treatment of distal radial fracture includes the use of bone cement. There
are five moderate-quality studies found, although one author reported on the same study
population in two different papers. The injection of remodellable bone cement, or the open
reduction and use of remodellable bone cement, was shown to provide improved anatomic
and functional outcomes compared to casting (Sanchez-Sotelo et al., 2000, Schmalholz,
1989) and external fixation (Kopylov et al., 1999, Schmalholz, 1990) and reducing
immobilization time (Kopylov et al., 2001). There is only one moderate-quality study on the
repair of triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) with distal radial fractures (Ekenstam et
al., 1989). In a small sample size study limited to Frykman II and VI, closed reduction and
casting had equivocal results to surgical repair. However, this study was published in 1989,
prior to more recent anatomic studies and case series reports on TFCC. Therefore, no
recommendation is made for TFCC repair based on insufficient evidence. There is no quality
evidence for specific internal fixation techniques in comparison to external fixation or other
immobilization techniques. However, there is one moderate-quality study of two internal
fixation techniques, which recommends against the use of pi-plates, which were more
difficult to match properly to distal radius, and resulted in worse wrist flexion and extension
outcomes than from ¼ tube plates (Hahnloser et al., 1999). Thus, with insufficient evidence
for comparison, there are no recommendations for internal fixation techniques.

Rationale
Most comparative studies for surgical intervention of distal radial fractures includes external
fixation using various named external fixators. In consideration of the topic, all studies using
external fixators are considered as one particular treatment group, as few comparisons are
made between individual types or brands of fixators. There are several moderate-quality
studies available for this treatment. Overall, the available data is weakened by studies with
small sample sizes, a lack of consistency in fracture types included in each study, and
inconsistency in reported final outcomes measures (i.e., functional, radiographic) and
duration of follow-up. Extra-articular fractures or distal forearm fractures that include nondisplaced intra-articular fractures can be treated initially with external immobilization, using
external fixation as a second option for fractures that fail reduction while immobilized.
External fixation likely does not provide improved functional results in the elderly. In
consideration of support for external fixation, 5 moderate-quality studies that included
either mixed fracture types or were limited to extra-articular, non comminuted and nondisplaced intra-articular fracture types, generally showed equivocal or non-statistically
significant positive trends in radiographic or functional outcomes when compared with
casting (Pring et al., 1988, Young et al., 2003, Kreder et al., 2006, McQueen et al., 1996,
Merchan et al., 1992). Another moderate-quality study compared plaster cast to external
fixation and found that patients with plaster casts showed significantly higher Maximum
Voluntary Contraction than patients with primary external fixation on day immobilization
device was removed until between 18 weeks and 1 year when the groups equalized
(Lagerstrom et al., 1999). Therefore, there is evidence supporting non-operative treatment
for these fractures using non-invasive immobilization techniques. However, for the more
severe fractures, including comminuted extra-articular and displaced comminuted intraarticular types, there are 6 moderate-quality studies that support improved clinical
outcomes from external fixation over casting (Howard et al., 1989, Jenkins et al., 1988,
Jenkins et al., 1987, Kapoor et al., 2000, Stein et al., 1990, Abbaszadegan et al., 1990). Thus,
there is strong evidence to support more invasive immobilization techniques for these more
severe injuries. One exception to this may be for those over age 65, as there is one
moderate-quality study that showed no difference in functional outcomes despite worse
anatomical outcomes, suggesting the final anatomical outcome is less important in this age

DISPLACED DISTAL RADIAL FRACTURE
Distal radial fractures with radiographic measurements of 10° or more of dorsal angulation,
more than 2 mm of radial shortening or with any degree of radial shift require reduction to
reduce the risk for deformity and disability. Closed reduction should result in no more than
5° of dorsal angulation and no more than 2mm of radial shortening. Unstable fractures are
defined as fractures with bone loss or bone involvement that will not allow for structural
integrity without the use of internal or external fixation of the bone. Examples include
fractures with dorsal comminution or radial lateral shift of more than 2mm, have been
proposed as limits for consideration of surgical intervention (590,591).
CLOSED REDUCTION TECHNIQUE FOR DISPLACED DISTAL RADIAL FRACTURES
Recommended
Manipulation and dynamic traction devices are recommended for closed reduction
technique for displaced distal radial fractures as they have demonstrated equivalent ability
to achieve initial reduction of injury.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
For closed reduction, there is one high-quality and two moderate-quality studies comparing
the effectiveness of manipulation and traction techniques for displaced Colles’ fracture.
There was no difference in immediate reduction results using Chinese finger dynamic
traction devices compared to manipulation under anesthesia (Earnshaw et al., 2002,
Kongsholm et al., 1987, Kongsholm et al., 1987). Long-term outcomes also showed no
differences in post reduction failures, as both methods have 25 to 29% loss of reduction
with casting. It is likely the loss of reduction is unrelated to reduction technique, and rather
more related to immobilization technique. In a group of elderly patients, there were no
differences in functional outcomes or deformity between those that underwent
manipulation and casting versus those that were non-reduced and casted if the degree of
displacement had less than 30° of dorsal angulation and 5mm of radial shortening (Kelly et
al., 1997).
Despite non-superiority of reduction outcomes for manipulation or dynamic traction, one
author in two papers reports lower rates of severe reduction pain and reduced long-term

216

neurological deficits with dynamic traction (paresthesia, reduced 2-point discrimination)
compared with manipulation under hematoma block (Kongsholm et al., 1987, Kongsholm et
al., 1987). These studies suggest the difference may have been related to the anesthetic
technique rather than the reduction technique.
As noted earlier, the lack of a standard fracture classification system across each of these
studies inhibits prognostic or treatment indications to be generalized. For these studies,
Earnshaw used criteria of >10° of dorsal angulation, > 5 mm radial shortening, no marked
comminution or displacement of articular surfaces. Kongsholm included mostly Frykman II,
VI, VII, VIII fractures in the study, which may have included comminuted fractures, and those
enrolled by Kelly included up to 5 mm of radial shortening and 30° of dorsal angulation.

Unlike casting for non-displaced and minimally displaced distal radial fractures, there are
few studies comparing casting technique and functional bracing for displaced distal radial
fractures and most of the available work was conducted more than 20 years ago. There is no
defined standard for casting technique and forearm positioning that provides significant
advantage over any other technique for displaced distal forearm fractures.
USE OF FUNCTIONAL BRACE OR SPLINT OVER TRADITIONAL CASTING FOR DISPLACED
DISTAL RADIAL FRACTURE
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of a functional brace or splint that will
allow mobilization of the hand while maintaining stabilization of the reduced displaced
distal radial fracture.

There are few studies that compare specific casting or immobilization techniques. Rather,
bracing and casting has been studied in the greater context of allowing hand functionality

dorsiflexion) and forearm position (pronation, supination) (Millett et al., 1995, Bunger et al.,
1984, Gupta, 1991, Rosetzsky, 1982, Sarmiento et al., 1980, Tumia et al., 2003, Wahlstrom,
1982). One moderate-quality study of 339 patients with non-specific displaced fractures
showed no difference in casting versus functional bracing (Tumia et al., 2003). Two
moderate quality studies found bracing in the supine position may have advantages for
intra-articular fractures (Bunger et al., 1984, Sarmiento et al., 1980), whereas bracing in
pronation may provide advantage for extra-articular fracture (Gupta, 1991). However,
another moderate-quality study with 250 participants found no differences between hand
and ulnar positioning (van der Linden, 1981). In several of these studies, the authors
concluded results were related to displacement of original fracture and degree of successful
reduction more than immobilization technique. Thus, there are insufficient data to
recommend specific casting or immobilization techniques for displaced Colles’ fractures.

found to have better anatomic outcomes (Kendall et al., 1997, Abbaszadegan et al., 1990),
lower remanipulation rates (Kendall et al., 1997), and better grip strength at 6 months

DYNAMIC REDUCTION FOR ACUTE DISTAL FOREARM FRACTURES
Recommended
Dynamic reduction is recommended as an alternative technique for distal forearm fractures
as it may result in less reduction pain than hematoma block, and may have a lower
neurologic complication rate than a hematoma block.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
Dynamic reduction which does not require anesthesia block may hold slight advantage over
hematoma block from the patient’s perspective, although there is one study of moderate
quality available on the topic, wherein less severe pain was reported during dynamic
reduction than those receiving local infiltration (Kongsholm et al., 1987). There was no
difference in reduction quality, and no longitudinal results were reported. The same author
reported in a different paper, likely of the same study group, that hematoma infiltration
resulted in higher subjective paresthesia or mild deficit in 2-point discrimination at 5 weeks
and 1 year compared with the dynamic traction group (Kongsholm et al., 1987). Hematoma
infiltration provided lower pain scores during reduction and quicker onset of analgesia than
patients receiving IV pentazocine (Talwin®) and diazepam (Valium®) (Singh et al., 1992).
Finally, in one moderate-quality study, hematoma block showed no difference with cubital
block, and both were judged to be substandard (Haasio, 1990).

DISTAL PHALANX FRACTURES AND SUBUNGUAL HEMATOMAS
OVERVIEW
Fingertip or distal phalangeal fractures are frequently cited as the most common fractures
of the hand, with the tuft being the most common (609). Fractures may or may not be
occupational. There are no recent quality incidence data available for tuft fractures, but
estimates are between 15 to 30% of all hand fractures are tuft fractures (610,611). Tuft
fractures are most often usually due to a crush injury of the fingertip (612), resulting in
comminuted or transverse fractures and are a common occupational injury. Often, they are
accompanied with nail bed laceration and subungual hematoma (613,614). Tuft fractures are
generally stable and heal uneventfully because of the soft tissue support of the fibrous
septae and nail plate (615,616). Crush fractures or avulsion fractures involving the proximal
base of the distal phalanx may also involve flexor or extensor tendons and may require
surgical intervention (616).
Patients have swelling, reduced range of motion, and tenderness of the fingertip. Patients
with accompanying subungual hematoma may have severe throbbing pain and obvious
discoloration of the affected nail.
Physical examination should include inspection and identification of localized swelling and
open wounds. Neurovascular status should be described. The DIP joint should be palpated
in each plane to assess point tenderness over ligament insertions. Passive range of motion
and joint stability should be assessed through dorsal, volar, and lateral stressing. An
estimate of subungual hematoma size relative to the nail bed surface should be noted. A
case series demonstrated fractures in 63% of patients with hematomas greater than 50% of
surface area, 43% of patients with hematomas 25 to 50% of nail surface, and 10% in those
with less than 25% of nail bed surface involvement (613). The DIP joint should be evaluated
for flexion and extension range of motion.
Tuft fracture should be suspected when a patient presents with a crush injury or
perpendicular shearing force injury to the fingertip, particularly if there is a subungual
hematoma. Injuries resulting in avulsion of the nail plate can also be associated with tuft
fractures.
Uncomplicated closed tuft fractures do not require follow-up, particularly if there is not a
need for work and activity limitations. Two or three appointments may be required for
gradual reduction in limitations. Patients should be advised that residual tenderness and
hypersensitivity to cold temperatures may persist for 6 months in a more than half of all
patients with this injury (617).
All work activities that can be accomplished while wearing a finger splint are appropriate.
Athletes may return to sports after the initial swelling and pain have resolved,

approximately 7 to 10 days. Activities requiring full distal joint mobility and forceful use may
be delayed as long as 4 to 6 weeks. Residual tenderness may be present for up to 6 months
(616)
.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Diagnosis is evident from clinical suspicion, physical examination findings, and x-ray
confirmation.
X-RAYS FOR DIAGNOSING TUFT FRACTURES
Recommended
X-rays are recommended to diagnose tuft fractures.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Clinical tuft fractures that do not involve the DIP joint do not require x-rays as they do not
alter treatment. Still, the threshold for obtaining x-rays for those fractures is low in the
event they may involve the joint.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Obtaining x-rays once is generally sufficient. Follow-up x-rays are rarely indicated aside from
complicated healing.
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating the use of x-rays for distal phalangeal/tuft fractures.
X-rays may assist in identifying fractures and the magnitude of the involvement of the DIP
joint surface, which if large enough may alter management in favor of surgery (see below).
As this section of the digit is readily accessible for physical examination, patients may be
treatable without x-rays as x-rays will not change the management of tuft fractures that do
not involve the joint. X-rays are recommended for assessment of fractures thought to
involve the DIP joint.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
SUBUNGUAL HEMATOMA
Management of subungual hematoma associated with a tuft fracture varies widely. There
are no quality RCTs investigating the treatment ramifications of no treatment, trephination,
nail plate removal, nail bed laceration repair, or conversion of closed fracture into open
fracture (613,614,618,619,620,621,622,623,624,625,626,627,628). As subungual hematoma is often associated
with nail bed laceration, many practitioners promote removing the nail and repairing the
nail bed to avoid future cosmetic defects (614). The primary concern for this procedure is the
potential to convert an underlying fracture into an open fracture (613-628).
Tuft fractures associated with nail avulsion may require reduction of the nail plate under the
eponychium, or removal if reduction cannot be performed. As with the removal of the nail
for other conditions, the eponychial space should be preserved by packing with petroleum
gauze cut in the shape of the nail to prevent scarring of the nail bed and stunted nail growth
(628)
. The nail or gauze should remain in place for 2 to 3 weeks to allow initial formation of a
new nail plate. Full growth of the new nail takes approximately 4 to 5 months. Open
fractures other than from subungual hematoma trephination of the distal phalanx require
cleansing, debridement, and inspection for foreign bodies. Orthopedic assistance is usually
not required for uncomplicated closures. Open fractures with extensive soft tissue damage
frequently are associated with chronic pain and disability and generally require assistance
from an orthopedic or hand surgeon.
TREPHINATION FOR MANAGEMENT OF SUBUNGUAL HEMATOMA
Recommended
Trephination is recommended for management of subungual hematoma.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are no quality studies regarding trephination or nail removal/laceration repair to
manage subungual hematoma (Seaberg et al., 1991, Simon et al., 1987, Batrick et al., 2003,
Bonisteel, 2008, Brown, 2002, Farrington, 1964, Hart et al., 1993, Meek et al., 1998,

Newmeyer et al., 1977, Palamarchuk et al., 1989, Roser et al., 1999, Salter et al., 2006,
Wang et al., 2001, Dean et al., 2012, Ciocon et al., 2006). In a prospective study of 47
patients with subungual hematoma involving 50% or more surface area of the nail, a nail
bed laceration was associated with fracture in 80% of patients. Thus, tuft fractures with
subungual hematoma have a high likelihood of an associated laceration (Simon et al., 1987).
However, another prospective study of 48 patients with subungual hematoma, 42% of
which had an underlying tuft fracture, were treated exclusively with electrocautery
trephination. At 10-months follow-up post-trephination, there were no infectious or
cosmetic complications despite not repairing the laceration or by converting a closed
fracture into an open fracture. Another prospective study conducted in children with
subungual hematoma compared nail removal and laceration repair to trephination over a 2year follow-up and concluded that there was no justification based on absence of adverse
clinical outcomes from trephination to perform nail removal and exploration (Roser et al.,
1999). Each participant had a short course of antibiotics. There were no case reports found
of osteomyelitis from trephination over hand tuft fracture, nor any reports of adverse
cosmetic outcomes (nail scarring, permanent depression) in patients with finger nail bed
laceration that were managed without suturing. Thus, the practice of avoiding trephination
over distal phalangeal fracture to avoid creating an open fracture, or the practice of
exploring and repairing nail bed lacerations associated with subungual hematoma appears
unsupported by the available literature.
Trephination is most commonly accomplished with a hot cautery unit. Successful trephining
with 29-gauge needle inserted below the nail plate reported (Kaya et al., 2003), as well as
fine point scalpel blade, surgical drill and laser have also been reported (Bonisteel, 2008)
Trephining gives good cosmetic and functional results (Batrick et al., 2003).

INITIAL CARE
Tuft fractures are initially treated by caring for accompanying soft tissue injury and splinting
of the finger to prevent further discomfort or injury. Reduction of the relatively uncommon
significantly displaced fractures should be attempted with dorsal traction followed by
immobilization in a volar splint. In the small percentage of patients, reduction cannot be
achieved and referral to an orthopedic surgeon for consideration of pinning may be
indicated (615).
Uncomplicated closed tuft fractures do not require follow-up, particularly if there is not a
need for work and activity limitations. Two or three appointments may be required for
gradual reduction in limitations. Patients should be advised that residual tenderness and
hypersensitivity to cold temperatures may persist for 6 months in a more than half of all
patients with this injury (629).
TIGHT CIRCUMFERENTIAL TAPING FOR TUFT FRACTURES
Not Recommended
Tight circumferential taping around the fingertip is not recommended for tuft fractures.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating immobilization for fractures. In the closed crush
fracture of the distal phalanx, the L-shaped Alumafoam splint placed on the volar aspect to
protect the soft tissues has been considered the best treatment, although quality
comparative trials are lacking. Splinting generally is maintained for approximately 3 weeks
(Chalmer et al., 2013, Leggit et al., 2006). Tight circumferential taping is not recommended
due to potential to impair circulation. Volar splinting is not invasive, has few adverse effects,
is low cost and is recommended.

PROTECTIVE SPLINTING OF DISTAL PHALANX FOR FRACTURES

Rationale
There are no quality studies of the use of physical or occupational therapy or other methods
for tuft fractures, and these injuries rarely require therapy. Joint mobilization therapy may
be useful for complicated injuries or post surgical fixation. A few appointments for purposes
of teaching range of motion exercises for recovery of full motion may be rarely indicated,
particularly for those with more severe injuries or those with a lack of improvement after
removal of splints. However, the vast majority of patients with tuft fractures require no
further treatment.

POST-TREPHINATION ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS FOR OPEN FRACTURES
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of post-trephination antibiotic
prophylaxis for open fractures.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
Antibiotic prophylaxis for open fractures is widely used. However, they may not be
necessary for open phalangeal fractures as a quality study did not show evidence of
improvements upon infection rates compared with aggressive irrigation and debridement as
there were equal numbers of soft tissue infections and no cases of osteomyelitis in either
group (Suprock et al., 1990). However, the study appears underpowered to detect these
relatively infrequent events. Use of antibiotics may be more strongly indicated for those
with risks for infection, such as patients with diabetes mellitus. Thus, there is no
recommendation for or against use of antibiotics and the threshold for use of antibiotics for
prophylaxis is suggested to be low.

TETANUS IMMUNIZATION STATUS FOR OPEN FRACTURES
Recommended
For open fractures, it is recommended that tetanus immunization status to be updated as
necessary.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Indications
Wounds that are not clean or burns if more than 5 years have elapsed since last tetanus
immunization (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009).
Rationale
There are no quality studies of tetanus immunization updating for open fractures. However,
these immunizations are widely used and believed to have been successful on a population
basis in reducing risk of tetanus over many decades. Tetanus immunizations are minimally
invasive, have low adverse effects, and are low cost. As the adverse effects of not
immunizing may be fatal, tetanus immunization updating for open wounds is
recommended. Wounds that are not clean or burns should require immunization if over 5
years since last immunization, rather than 10 years (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2009). Patients without a completed immunization series of 3 injections should
receive tetanus immune globulin along with immunization.

SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
SURGERY FOR TUFT FRACTURES
No Recommendation
Distal phalangeal diaphyseal fractures rarely require operative fixation, except those that
are extremely displaced, unable to be reduced or are unstable. Retrograde percutaneous
Kirschner-wire fixation is the preferred internal fixation technique.

Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operative, appointments should be scheduled
generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there has been functional improvements yet there
are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is often
helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week appointments)
may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe, and there is
ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g., increased
grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities, increased
duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are appropriate when
there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent objective functional
gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the therapy.

MIDDLE AND PROXIMAL PHALANGEAL AND METACARPAL FRACTURES
OVERVIEW
Fractures of the proximal and middle phalanges represent approximately 46% of fractures
of the hand and wrist (609,630). The more severe fractures are among the most challenging
injuries that hand surgeons and therapists treat (631). Fortunately, most are uncomplicated
and are non-surgical cases (632,633,634). Fractures may or may not be occupational. Physicians
who encounter hand fractures must be able to properly diagnose and manage these hand
fractures, as improper management may result in permanent impairment and disability
from bone shortening, permanent angulation, joint and finger stiffness, and loss of hand
function. Proximal phalangeal fractures particularly have a significant potential for hand
impairment particularly if suboptimally managed because of the importance of this bone in
longitudinal transfer of axial forces between the carpal and distal phalangeal joints (615), and
the PIP joint for digit mobility. Decisions for surgical intervention should be offered upon
careful consideration balancing risk of superior radiographic reduction with higher risk of
debilitating stiffness from the post-operative rehabilitative state, with confidence that nonoperative therapy can be improved upon (635).
Metacarpal fractures comprise roughly 1/3 of hand fractures, with fifth metacarpal neck
fractures (sometimes called “Boxer’s fracture”) accounting for 1/3 to 1/2 of these injuries
(630,636)
, and fractures of the thumb constituting another 25% (637). They occur most
commonly from a direct blow to the bone causing transverse shaft fracture or through an
axial loading blow such as striking an object with a closed fist. Isolated fractures of the third
and fourth metacarpals are uncommon and usually involve one or more the neighboring
metacarpals.
The initial assessment involves a search for confirmation of fracture. Limited or guarded
range of motion with pain, local tenderness, swelling, deformity and possibly ecchymosis
over the affected area are common. Careful history regarding the mechanism of injury
including and direct axial blow or angular or rotational trauma will reflect substantially on
the nature of the fracture and its inherent stability (616).

Prior to fracture manipulation, physical examination includes evaluation of digital nerves
using two point discrimination or pin prick, tendon and ligament integrity with active and
passive range of motion at each joint, vascular status with capillary refill, and surrounding
soft tissue structures of affected areas (615). Finger shortening or knuckle depression may be
present. Bone alignment should be checked for rotational deformity by finger flexion of
hand, with the nails pointing toward the scaphoid tubercle. The natural alignment will be
disrupted if a rotational fracture is present, such that one finger will overlap another.
There are no quality studies on frequency or timing of return visits. X-rays for follow-up of
all metacarpal fractures are reasonable; however, fractures at risk for displacement after
reduction are particularly recommended to have repeat radiographic studies 7 to 10 days
after injury to ensure no further displacement or malrotation has occurred. Motion and
other hand exercises should be started at the earliest date the fracture becomes stable.
Fracture type and displacement can be partially predicted by the underlying anatomic
structures of the affected digit. Fractures of the proximal phalanx, which has no tendinous
attachments, typically result in volar angulation. In contrast, the middle phalanx has
insertions of the flexor digitorum superficialis along the volar surface, such that fractures at
the base and shaft usually have a dorsal angulation because of the action of the flexor
tendons, whereas fractures of the distal neck will usually have a volar angulation as the
flexors act to pull the distal fragment (638). Fifth metacarpal fractures usually displace at a
volar angle because of the action of the interosseous muscles (639). Other metacarpal
fractures tend to angulate dorsally owing to the unbalanced pull of the interosseous
muscles and extrinsic finger flexors on the distal fragment (640). In cases where there is
hardware placed, subsequent hardware removal is indicated in cases of: (1) protruding
hardware, (2) pain attributed to the hardware, (3) broken hardware on imaging, and/or (4)
positive anesthetic injection response.
Activities restrictions should provide for immobilization of affected finger or hand, but
otherwise activities should be allowed.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Diagnosis is determined by clinical suspicion evident from history, physical examination
findings and x-ray confirmation.
X-RAYS FOR DIAGNOSING PHALANGEAL OR METACARPAL FRACTURES
Recommended
X-rays are recommended for diagnosing phalangeal or metacarpal fractures and should
include three projections, including a posteroanterior, lateral, and oblique view. A true
lateral projection isolating the involved digit is required.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
INITIAL CARE
Initial management should include treatment of soft tissue injuries (641) and pain control
following completion of physical examination. Regional anesthesia should be administered
to complete diagnostic assessment (passive range of motion, rotational alignment) and to
perform closed reduction of the fracture, although not until neurovascular examination is
documented.
Regional anesthesia is typically performed through injection of local anesthetic as a digital
block through one of many described techniques including digital ring block, palmar
subcutaneous block, metacarpal block, and volar thecal block. The traditional digital block
technique, also known as dorsal subcutaneous block, and occasionally referred to as
metacarpal block, includes instilling local anesthetic from a dorsal approach into the
webspace lateral to each side of the injured finger. A true metacarpal block is similar to ring
block, but at the metacarpal head. A volar thecal block, also referred to as transthecal block,
is the instillation of local anesthetic into the potential space of the tendon sheath at the
distal palmar crease (A-1 pulley) proximal to the injured digit. The palmar subcutaneous
block is performed at the same location as the thecal block, but subcutaneously. Other block
techniques include ulnar or radial block injuries that are proximal to the phalanx, such as for

metacarpal injuries, and hematoma block which is the direct injection of local anesthetic
into the fracture hematoma.
DIGITAL BLOCK – TRADITIONAL (RING) BLOCK TECHNIQUE, PALMAR SUBCUTANEOUS
BLOCK
Recommended
The ring block technique, followed by volar subcutaneous block, is moderately
recommended for digital anesthesia, as it provides more effective coverage of dorsal
phalangeal injuries than the other techniques.
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
For phalangeal fractures, there is clear evidence that the three most common digital blocks
are similarly effective in onset and depth of anesthesia, although each has advantages and
drawbacks particular to the specific technique. However, although it requires two
punctures, the traditional digit or ring block has been found to be as effective or more
effective than the other two block types as it provides better anesthetic results for the
dorsal finger as compared to palmar (subcutaneous) block (Knoop et al., 1994, Williams et
al., 2006, Yin et al., 2006) and transthecal block (Cummings et al., 2004, Hill et al., 1995,
Keramidas et al., 2004). There is no clear difference in the primary anesthesia outcomes
between transthecal and palmar techniques (Low et al., 1997, Low et al., 1997, Hung et al.,
2005), although patients preferred the subcutaneous technique and many reported residual
pain at the block site 24 hours after injection in the transthecal block group. Subjects in the
ring block were also satisfied with the technique compared to transthecal blocks, and were
rated very similar to palmar block despite having two injections. Thus, the subcutaneous
techniques of ring block palmar subcutaneous block are recommended over transthecal
block mainly related to patient preference and residual pain, and ring block is recommended
as the first line technique as it is less likely to have incomplete anesthesia of the dorsal
finger. There are no quality studies for hematoma block in the hand, but they have been
reported effective in distal radius, ulnar, and ankle injuries. Hematoma block may provide
advantage for proximal metacarpal injuries over ulnar/radial blocks.

NSAIDS FOR PHALANGEAL OR METACARPAL FRACTURES
Recommended
NSAIDs are recommended to control pain from phalangeal or metacarpal fractures.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)

Indications
Pain due to phalangeal or metacarpal fracture.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Scheduled dosage rather than as needed is generally preferable.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution of pain, lack of efficacy, development of adverse effects particularly
gastrointestinal.
Rationale
There is no quality evidence, however these medications are thought to be effective for
control of swelling and pain in the initial stages of injury, are not invasive, have low adverse
effects, are low cost, and thus are recommended. While there have been some concerns
regarding delayed fracture healing, other studies have suggested no delayed bone healing
(see Distal Forearm Fractures section). These concerns appear outweighed by pain
management concerns.

ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS FOR OPEN PHALANGEAL FRACTURES
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for open

Antibiotic prophylaxis for open phalangeal fractures are commonly used but may not be
necessary based on the results of a prospective (non-randomized) trial of 91 open
phalangeal fractures in fingers with intact digital arteries which compared aggressive

MIDDLE AND PROXIMAL PHALANX FRACTURES
There are no quality studies comparing non-operative treatment, percutaneous fixation,
bone screws, or plates for middle and proximal phalangeal fractures. There also are no
quality studies defining acceptable limits of displacement for non-operative management,
determining the ideal splint time or duration of internal or external fixation, making
comparisons of fixation techniques or defining ideal post-operative rehabilitation
impractical. Immobilization or fixation technique is therefore dictated by the physical and
radiographic findings. More than 90% of phalangeal fractures can be managed nonoperatively (634,642). Non-operative management techniques include padded aluminum
splints, buddy tape, functional splinting, and gutter casting.
Except for 5th metacarpal neck fractures, there are no quality studies comparing nonoperative management, percutaneous fixation, bone screws, or plates. Further, there are no
quality studies defining acceptable limits of displacement for non-operative management,
determining the ideal splint time or duration of internal or external fixation, making
comparisons of fixation techniques or defining ideal post-operative rehabilitation.

Rationale
There are no quality studies that address non-operative management of acute nondisplaced and stable transverse diaphyseal fractures of the middle and proximal phalanges.
These fractures have good results with non-operative management. The affected digit is
immobilized with neighboring digit in 70 to 90° of MCP flexion for 1 to 3 weeks. The
tolerance limits for non-operative management after closed reduction are angulation of 10°,
shortening less than 2mm, bone apposition of greater than 50%, and no malrotation.
Displacement outside these limits should be evaluated for treatment with closed reduction
and percutaneous fixation, or upon failure of closed reduction, open reduction and internal
fixation (Klein et al., 2000, Kozin et al., 2000).

NON-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF NON-DISPLACED OBLIQUE FRACTURES OF THE
MIDDLE AND PROXIMAL PHALANGES
Recommended
Non-operative management of non-displaced oblique fractures of the middle and proximal
phalanges is recommended as these fractures are usually stable and require rigid
immobilization alone.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Examinations weekly for the first 3 weeks.
Rationale
There are no quality studies for management of oblique fractures. Buddy taping should not
be used as rotational correction may not occur. The fracture must be examined weekly for
the first 3 weeks. Displaced fractures can be stabilized with closed reduction and

percutaneous Kirschner wires or through open reduction with interfragmentary screw or
plate-and-screw devices. Long oblique fractures (length double the diameter of bone at
fracture site) can be stabilized by closed reduction and percutaneous Kirschner wires (Lee et
al., 2000, Kozin et al., 2000) or with intramedullary wires (Freeland et al., 2006).

CLOSED REDUCTION WITH SPLINTING FOR BASE PHALANX FRACTURES
Recommended
Closed reduction with splinting is recommended for base phalanx fractures (Baratz et al.,
1997).
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Involvement of less than 40% of the middle phalanx base.
Rationale
There are no quality studies for management of base fractures. However, base fractures are
commonly a fracture-dislocation of the PIP joint and consists of an avulsion fracture of the
volar lip of the middle phalanx with dorsal subluxation of the remaining base of the middle
phalanx. Closed reduction with splinting is recommended (Baratz et al., 1997) if the fracture
involves less than 40% of the middle phalanx base. If this fails, treatment is by pin fixation.
Dynamic traction is another effective described technique for base fractures and also for the
treatment of comminuted intra-articular fractures (Pilon fractures) of the base of the middle
phalanx. Unstable displaced articular fractures at the base of the proximal phalanx are
treated with percutaneous wires crossing the MCP joint to hold the joint reduced, and a
transverse wire holding the fracture alignment similar to Bennett’s fracture of the thumb
(Baratz et al., 1997).

SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF CONDYLAR FRACTURES
Recommended
Surgical management of condylar fractures is recommended as these fractures are unstable.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
Displaced oblique fractures involving a single condyle are unstable, and are stabilized
operatively with two transverse pins or screws. Bicondylar fractures are reconstructed with
screws and connected to the shaft with a pin or through the use of a condylar plate (Lee et
al., 2000, Baratz et al., 1997).

SURGICAL MANAGEMENT FOR MALROTATED PHALANGEAL FRACTURES
Recommended
Surgical management for malrotated phalangeal fractures is recommended as deformity
and impairment may result.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are no quality studies for Bennett’s or Rolando’s fractures of the thumb. Bennett’s
fracture of the thumb is a common metacarpal base fracture associated with dislocation,
and requires operative fixation with one or two wires to maintain alignment of the shaft and
joint surface, as does the base of the 5th metacarpal (Klein et al., 2000). Rolando’s fracture
is a comminuted intra-articular burst fracture at the thumb base requiring internal and
external fixation to preserve metacarpal length and reapproximate articular fragments
(McNemar et al., 2003).

ACETAMINOPHEN FOR PHALANGEAL OR METACARPAL FRACTURES
Recommended
Acetaminophen is recommended to control pain from phalangeal or metacarpal fractures.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Pain due to phalangeal or metacarpal fracture.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Scheduled dosage rather than as needed is generally preferable.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution of pain, lack of efficacy, development of adverse effects particularly
gastrointestinal.
Rationale
There is no quality evidence; however, these medications are thought to be effective for
control of swelling and pain in the initial stages of injury, are not invasive, have low adverse
effects, are low cost, and thus are recommended. While there have been some concerns
regarding delayed fracture healing, other studies have suggested no delayed bone healing
(see Distal Forearm Fractures section). These concerns appear outweighed by pain
management concerns.

NON-OPERATIVE TREATMENT OF DISTAL METACARPAL HEAD FRACTURE
Recommended
Non-operative treatment of distal metacarpal head fractures using closed reduction and
protective immobilization with radial or ulnar gutter splint is recommended for fractures
with less than 20% of joint involvement.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Fractures with less than 20% of joint involvement.
Rationale
There are no quality studies that address non-operative treatment of acute distal
metacarpal head fractures. Metacarpal neck fractures are common extra-articular fractures
at the base of the head, usually the result of axial impaction, resulting in the neck being
displaced dorsally and the metacarpal head being displaced volarly. Recommendations are
based on prior clinical experience. Cases with greater than 20% joint involvement likely
require open reduction and internal fixation followed by nearly immediate motion
(McNemar et al., 2003).

Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: percutaneous

NON-OPERATIVE TREATMENT OF DISTAL METACARPAL HEAD FRACTURE WITH
ACCEPTABLE ANGULATION
Recommended
Non-operative treatment of distal metacarpal head fracture using angulation is
recommended.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

251

Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Degree of angulation 15° in the ring finger and 10° in the index and long fingers.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
These fractures heal quickly in 3 to 4 weeks with a gutter or radial splint maintaining MCP
joint flexion. Operative fixation is usually with percutaneous pinning (McNemar et al., 2003).
Rationale
Treatment of Boxer’s fracture, or 5th metacarpal neck fracture, varies widely, with
proponents of casting, splinting, taping, and operative fixation. There are no quality studies
comparing non-operative and operative techniques, although there are two prospective
trials with long-term follow-up suggesting non-operative treatment with early mobilization
provides comparable outcomes to operative intervention, and perhaps is superior as
operative fixation may increase the risk for metacarpohamate joint osteoarthrosis
(Papaloizos et al., 2000), although it may result in slightly more cosmetic deformity
(McKerrell et al., 1987).

NON-OPERATIVE TREATMENT OF FIFTH METACARPAL NECK FRACTURES (BOXER’S
FRACTURE)
Recommended
Non-operative treatment is recommended before surgical treatment for most 5th
metacarpal neck fractures as the outcomes are similar both functionally and anatomically.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

252

Rationale
There are 11 moderate-quality studies available comparing the effectiveness of different
non-operative measures and no clear evidence of superiority of one approach over another
(Braakman et al., 1998, Harding et al., 2001, Kuokkanen et al., 1999, Statius Muller et al.,
2003, Hofmeister et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2015, Konradsen et al., 1990, Krukhaug et al., 2009,
McMahon et al., 1994, Randall et al., 1992, Winter et al., 2007). A Cochrane review also
concluded that no single non-operative treatment regimen for fracture of the neck of the
5th metacarpal can be recommended as superior to another in results (Poolman et al.,
2005). However, there is moderate evidence supporting functional therapies in general,
with two moderate-quality studies supporting functional therapies over casting or splinting.
Functional taping provided better functional outcome with no increase in deformity over
casting (Braakman et al., 1998), and treatment by compression bandage without reduction
or splinting with a mean angulation angle of 48° had equal functional outcomes with closed
reduction and splinting (Kuokkanen et al., 1999). Another moderate-quality study supports
the use of strategic metacarpal bracing (3-point brace), another type of functional therapy,
which provided equivalent functional outcomes to neighbor strapping but with less pain
(Harding et al., 2001).
Ulnar gutter cast was compared with functional mobilization (pressure bandage for 1 week)
in patients with 70° angulation or less and no rotation of the 5th metacarpal. Although the
study was limited by small sample size, there were no differences in subjective symptoms of
pain, return to work and hobby, or the need for physiotherapy (Statius Muller et al., 2003).
Several non-randomized prospective and retrospective trials with long-term follow up (up to
4 years) of patients treated without immobilization support these findings (Arafa et al.,
1986, Breddam et al., 1995, Ford et al., 1989). Other methods described in the literature for
non-operative management with reported efficacy include fracture brace (Jones, 1995),
modified Thomine brace (Trabelsi et al., 2001), and a glove cast (Toronto et al., 1996).
However, there is no recommendation for or against any of these interventions as there is
insufficient evidence.
There is no consensus on the degree of acceptable volar angulation manageable with nonoperative treatment. It is reported as 30° in a small prospective case series of 18 patients
(Kanatli et al., 2002) followed for a mean of 20 months, and 60° and 70° in early mobilization
trials (Kuokkanen et al., 1999, Statius Muller et al., 2003). Intra-articular fractures have also
been reported to be successfully treated non-operatively, although comparison of nonoperatively and operative management demonstrated high level of intermittent pain (38%),
49% decreased grip, and 65 radiographic signs of osteoarthritis in both groups (KjaerPetersen et al., 1992).

USE OF FUNCTIONAL THERAPIES RATHER THAN CASTING OR SPLINTING FOR FIFTH

Recommended
The use of functional therapies including taping, functional bracing, and strapping is
moderately recommended over casting or ulnar splinting for 5th metacarpal neck fractures.
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are 11 moderate-quality studies available comparing the effectiveness of different
non-operative measures and no clear evidence of superiority of one approach over another
(Braakman et al., 1998, Harding et al., 2001, Kuokkanen et al., 1999, Statius Muller et al.,

ROUTINE X-RAYS IN FOLLOW-UP OF FIFTH METACARPAL NECK FRACTURES
Not Recommended
Routine x-ray for follow-up of non-operative treatment of 5th metacarpal fractures is not
recommended as it has little clinical impact on fracture management.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
Routine radiographs in follow-up of non-operative treatment for 5th metacarpal neck
fracture were not found to be of clinical utility, except in only one case from two
retrospective studies of 307 patients and 288 patients (Braakman et al., 1996). Follow-up
radiographs are indicated if physical examination suggests loss of reduction or instability
within 1 week of the fracture.
EXERCISE FOR PHALANGEAL AND METACARPAL FRACTURES
Sometimes Recommended
Exercise is not indicated acutely. Some patients have considerable, functional deficits after
casting and require exercise. For patients with residual deficits, particularly post-operatively,
see recommendations for carpal tunnel syndrome.

In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operative, appointments should be scheduled
generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there has been functional improvements yet there
are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is often
helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week appointments)
may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe, and there is
ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g., increased
grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities, increased
duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are appropriate when
there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent objective functional
gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the therapy.

SHAFT METACARPAL FRACTURES
Shaft metacarpal fractures are usually transverse, oblique, spiral or comminuted.
Determination of whether or not a fracture can be managed non-operatively is unclear.
NON-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF METACARPAL SHAFT FRACTURES
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against non-operative management of metacarpal shaft
fractures.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies and there are conflicting opinions regarding whether any
angulation of the middle and index finger is acceptable (McNemar et al., 2003), versus
whether up to 15° of dorsal angulation of the middle and index finger (Freeland et al., 2006)
can be tolerated. The ring finger is thought to tolerate 20° (McNemar et al., 2003). There is

256

general agreement that rotational deformity is poorly tolerated. Thumb shaft fractures are
rare, and those with less than 30° angulation can be managed with forearm-hand-based
opponens splint for 3 to 4 weeks. Parameters of fifth digit fractures are discussed separately
(see Boxer’s Fracture). Ultimately, decisions for non-operative versus surgical intervention
balance acceptance of metacarpal shortening with risks accompanying surgical intervention.
Oblique fractures likely benefit from fixation (intra-medullary wires) (Freeland et al., 2006)
to prevent shortening. If adequate closed reduction is achieved and the fracture is stable, a
3-point brace (pressure points over the fracture apex and two counter-pressure points
proximal and distal on the opposite side) can be used. Metacarpal shaft fractures that
cannot be reduced, are unstable, or have multiple neighboring shaft fractures require
fixation (pinning, wire, plate, lag screws).

Surgical management of base fractures of the proximal metacarpal is recommended as
these fractures are rarely stable and require percutaneous pins or screws to maintain

Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Extra-articular fractures with up to 15° of deformity in the 4th and 5th metacarpals, and
only 5° in the 2nd and 3rd metacarpals can be managed with immobilization using a gutter
splint holding the MCP in 70° flexion, wrist in neutral position, and allowing movement of
the PIP and DIP joints (McNemar et al., 2003).

FOLLOW-UP VISITS FOR METACARPAL FRACTURES AT RISK FOR DISPLACEMENT
Recommended
Follow-up visits are recommended for metacarpal fractures at risk for displacement.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Motion and other hand exercises should be started at the earliest date the fracture
becomes stable.
Rationale
There are no quality studies on frequency or timing of return visits. X-rays for follow-up of
all metacarpal fractures are reasonable; however, fractures at risk for displacement after
reduction are particularly recommended to have repeat radiographic studies 7 to 10 days
after injury to ensure no further displacement or malrotation has occurred.
ICE FOR ACUTE METACARPAL FRACTURES
Recommended
Ice is recommended for controlling edema related to acute metacarpal fractures.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies for physical methods of metacarpal fracture management.
However, it is believed that controlling edema and early mobilization result in a more
favorable outcome. Inflammation associated with traumatic injury, fracture hematoma and
any resultant soft tissue damage from fracture displacement including adjacent tendons and
ligaments results in edema and routine tissue repair processes. Immobilization in the
presence of these inflammatory processes can result in adhesions to tendons, ligaments,
capsules, or skin and subsequent stiffness and loss of function (Saunders, 1989). Phalangeal
fractures respond less favorably to immobilization than metacarpal fractures, with a
predicted 84% return of motion, compared to 96% return in metacarpal fractures.

Immobilization continued longer than 4 weeks is reported to further reduce the return to
motion to 66% (Hardy, 2004).
There are no quality studies defining the efficacy or advantages of specific physical methods
in reducing the effect of inflammation and immobilization. Control of edema after injury has
been thought to be important in restoring function (Freeland, 2000). Ice, compression, and
elevation should be emphasized, with particular emphasis on hand elevation overnight
(Eccles, 1956).
Early mobilization to promote venous return via muscle contraction and thus reduce
swelling and propensity towards complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is advocated for
stable fractures. Early motion of simple metacarpal fractures initiated within 21 days of
injury is likely to result in earlier recovery of motion and strength, and earlier return to work
without adversely impacting fracture alignment (Freeland, 2000). Tendon gliding range of
motion exercises should be initiated as soon as possible based on the fracture
immobilization method.

SCAPHOID FRACTURES
OVERVIEW
Scaphoid fractures, also known as wrist navicular fractures, are among the most common
fractures of the carpal bones (643), occurring most commonly in young males. Most are not
occupational, but some clearly are work-related. The scaphoid is located at the base of the
thenar eminence (thumb side), just distal to the volar wrist crease, and acts to transfer the
compression loads between the hand and forearm. It also maintains normal wrist motion,
carpal stability and function of the wrist flexor and extensor tendons (644). The primary
mechanism of scaphoid injury is a fall on the outstretched hand, or from axial loading with a
closed fist such as grasping a steering wheel in an auto accident (645). Scaphoid fractures are
prone to non-union and avascular necrosis, particularly those involving the proximal third of
the navicular, and especially if displaced. Healing problems in the proximal third have been
attributed to limited blood supply that is disrupted by the fracture plane (646). A history of
fracture, as well as non-union both increase risk for development of osteoarthrosis. In cases
where there is hardware placed, subsequent hardware removal is indicated in cases of: (1)
protruding hardware, (2) pain attributed to the hardware, (3) broken hardware on imaging,
and/or (4) positive anesthetic injection response.

The main initial tasks are to confirm a fracture, identify those patients with fractures best
treated with surgery, and treat those with a high clinical suspicion of fracture with
appropriate splinting. A history of sufficient injury potential is important. Patients frequently
complain of persistent swelling and tenderness near the thumb base in the area of the
scaphoid. Gripping and wrist motion may be painful.
Historical features most commonly involve a high-energy injury such as a fall on an
outstretched, extended hand with immediate, non-radiating pain in the radial carpus. Other
common mechanisms include grasping a steering wheel in a frontal motor vehicle crash, or
direct blow to the scaphoid such as when using the heel of the wrist as a hammer.
Physical examination findings include antalgic behavior with avoidance of use of the hand,
and tenderness over the scaphoid tubercle (647,648,649). Scaphoid tubercle tenderness may be
more sensitive and specific than snuffbox tenderness. The scaphoid tubercle is located at
the volar wrist at the junction of the distal wrist crease under the flexor carpi radialis. The
tubercle becomes prominent and readily palpable with radial deviation of the wrist. Patients
may also have tenderness over the snuffbox, absence of tenderness in the distal radius,
wrist joint effusion (650,651,652), and scaphoid pain on axial loading of the thumb (“scaphoid
compression test”) (648,653). However, many of these findings may also be present without
scaphoid fracture. An isolated finding of snuffbox tenderness appears to be sensitive, but
has poor positive predictive value for scaphoid fracture (646,649,654).
Duration of immobilization is typically 6 to 8 weeks to develop resolution of tenderness and
for imaging evidence of healing (655,656). After 6 to 8 weeks, the cast should be removed,
imaging repeated, and casts reapplied for an additional 3 to 6 weeks, with a repeating
process until evidence of fracture healing is documented. The average casting time for nondisplaced fractures is 10 weeks (655), with all expected to heal in 6 months (657).
A clinical impression is made upon history of appropriate injury mechanism, physical
examination findings of substantial tenderness particularly over the scaphoid tubercle.
Findings of snuffbox tenderness, positive axial compression of thumb test, and effusion in
the wrist (possibly echymosis) should be sought. A fracture identified on imaging that
includes a “scaphoid view” confirms that diagnostic impression. Fracture is not always
confirmed on initial standard wrist x-rays, although those fractures identified later are by
definition non-displaced and have good clinical outcomes with subsequent non-operative
treatment. The differential diagnosis includes wrist sprain, undisplaced epiphyseal fractures
of the distal portion of the radius in children, fracture of the hook of the hamate, avulsion
fracture of the triquestrum, carpal instability, distal ulna subluxation, de Quervain’s
tenosynovitis, radioscaphoid arthrosis, scapholunate dislocation, and tri-scaphoid arthrosis.
Activities should be modified to allow for the splinting and immobilization of the carpal
bones. In a moderate-quality study comparing surgical fixation to non-operative treatment
(657)
, the mean range of time for Scottish patients with non-displaced scaphoid fracture to
return to normal daily activities living with non-operative treatment was 1 week for
dressing, 1 week for washing, 2. 8 weeks for shopping, and 2. 7 weeks for housework. The
mean time for returning to full employment was 11. 4 weeks, and to full sports 15. 5 weeks.
The mean return time of the operative group was not statistically different except to full
employment and full sports, which were 3. 8 weeks and 6. 4 weeks respectively (657). While
operative fixation of non-displaced scaphoid fracture may reduce short term disability,

there is a reported 11-fold increased risk of scaphotrapezial arthritis compared with those
non-operatively treated (655).

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
X-RAYS FOR DIAGNOSING SCAPHOID FRACTURES
Recommended
X-rays are recommended for diagnostic purposes that include at least 3 to 4 views including
a “scaphoid view” (Schubert, 2000).
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating x-rays for scaphoid fractures. However, x-rays have
been used for decades to evaluate these fractures, identify those requiring surgical
treatment, and to evaluate healing; thus, they are recommended to diagnose scaphoid
fracture.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: x-ray, scaphoid
fracture, diagnostic, diagnosis, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, predictive value of tests, efficacy, efficiency, diagnostic, diagnosis,
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and predictive
value of tests, efficacy, and efficiency. We found and reviewed 2 articles in PubMed, 934 in
Scopus, 2 in CINAHL, 9 Cochrane Library, and 0 from Google Scholar. We considered for
inclusion 0 from PubMed, 0 from Scopus, 1 from CINAHL, 0 from Cochrane Library, 0 from
Google Scholar, and 2 from other sources. Of the 3 articles considered for inclusion 3
diagnostic studies met the inclusion criteria.
FOLLOW-UP X-RAYS FOR SCAPHOID FRACTURES
Recommended
Follow-up x-rays in 2 weeks are recommended for evaluation of potential scaphoid fractures
(Leslie et al., 1981), particularly for patients with a high clinical suspicion of fracture, but
negative initial x-rays.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)

fracture.

diagnostic studies met the inclusion criteria.
MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING FOR DIAGNOSING SCAPHOID FRACTURES
Recommended
MRI is moderately recommended for diagnosis of occult scaphoid fractures when clinical
suspicion remains high despite negative x-rays (Tiel-van Buul et al., 1993, Mallee et al.,
2011, Ganel et al., 1979, Murphy et al., 1995, Tiel-van Buul et al., 1993, Brismar, 1988).
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Clinical suspicion of scaphoid fracture but negative x-rays.
Rationale
MRI is not required for the majority of scaphoid fractures. However, for patients with a
clinical suspicion of scaphoid fracture, but negative x-rays, current treatment
recommendations are generally to splint the hand, thus often necessitating prolonged lack
of use and lost productivity. A moderate-quality study has reported cost effectiveness of
MRI to diagnose occult scaphoid fractures and reduce lost productivity for those without xray imaging evidence of fractures (Brooks et al., 2005). Two moderate quality studies have
suggested comparable results between CT and MRI (Mallee et al., 2011, Fotiadou et al.,
2011), although two other studies suggested CT was better to evaluate cortical involvement
(Ilica et al., 2011, Memarsadeghi et al., 2006). Thus, as there is evidence to support its use
among these select patients, MRI is recommended.

HIGH-SPATIAL RESOLUTION SONOGRAPHY FOR DIAGNOSING SCAPHOID FRACTURES
Recommended
High-spatial resolution sonography is recommended to diagnose occult scaphoid fractures
when clinical suspicion remains high despite negative x-rays.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are a few quality studies regarding the use of high-spatial resolution sonography to
diagnose scaphoid fractures, with data suggesting reasonable reliability (Fusetti et al., 2005).
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: high spatial

COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) IMAGING FOR DIAGNOSING SCAPHOID FRACTURES
Recommended
CT imaging is moderately recommended to diagnose occult scaphoid fractures when clinical
suspicion remains high despite negative x-rays. Quality studies include multiplanar
reconstructive CT (Hannemann et al., 2013).
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are some quality studies regarding the use of CT to diagnose scaphoid fractures,
although false positives occur (Adey et al., 2007). One comparative trial was unable to

confirm CT as superior to bone scan (Rhemrev et al., 2010). A retrospective case series study
reported that 22% (n = 118) of patients with negative x-rays, but with clinical suspicion of
scaphoid fracture, were confirmed positive by CT imaging (Nguyen et al., 2008). There are
no studies comparing MRI with CT with bone scanning and no recommendation is made for
one over the other. Two moderate quality studies have suggested comparable results
between CT and MRI (Mallee et al., 2011, Fotiadou et al., 2011) although two other studies
suggested CT was better to evaluate cortical involvement (Ilica et al., 2011, Memarsadeghi
et al., 2006) For patients with continuing symptoms suggestive of scaphoid fracture, but
absence of findings on repeat x-ray, CT scan has been reported to be an effective imaging
technique (Biondetti et al., 1987, Pennes et al., 1989). Therefore, CT imaging for those with
clinical impression of fracture but negative x-rays is recommended.

BONE SCANNING FOR DIAGNOSING SCAPHOID FRACTURES
Recommended
Bone scanning is recommended to diagnose occult scaphoid fractures when clinical
suspicion remains high despite negative x-rays.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
At least 48 hours after the injury with continuing clinic suspicion of scaphoid fracture (Rolfe
et al., 1981).
Rationale
There are few quality studies on bone scanning for scaphoid fracture and suggesting utility
(Stordahl et al., 1984, Rolfe et al., 1981, Nielsen et al., 1983, O'Carroll et al., 1982). Bone
scans are not required for evaluation of the majority of patients with scaphoid fractures.
However, in those patients with a clinical suspicion of scaphoid fracture but negative x-rays,
bone scans may assist in securing an earlier diagnosis that may obviate prolonged splinting
in those without a fracture. Thus, bone scans are recommended for these select patients.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
INITIAL CARE
Casting has been long been traditionally used as a primary intervention, with successful
union being achieved 88 to 95% of the time (658,659). Typically, a Colles’ cast is recommended
with the wrist in approximately 20° anatomic extension (functionally neutral posture),
although many practitioners prefer a thumb spica cast (655,660,661). High-risk scaphoid
fractures should be promptly referred to hand or orthopaedic surgical specialists for
definitive treatment because of the higher risk of these fractures developing a nonunion,
malunion, or degenerative joint disease.
Duration of immobilization is typically 6 to 8 weeks to develop resolution of tenderness and
for imaging evidence of healing. After 6 to 8 weeks, the cast should be removed, imaging
repeated, and casts reapplied for an additional 3 to 6 weeks, with a repeating process until
evidence of fracture healing is documented. The average casting time for non-displaced
fractures is 10 weeks, with all expected to heal in 6 months.
WRIST SPLINTING FOR SCAPHOID TUBERCLE FRACTURES
Recommended
Wrist splinting is recommended for treatment of scaphoid tubercle fractures.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating wrist splinting for treatment of scaphoid tubercle
fractures. However, clinical experience suggests splinting may suffice, as these fractures
heal well due to adequate blood supply (Symes et al., 2011). Splinting is not invasive, has
few adverse effects, is low cost, and thus is recommended.

randomized trials and 1 systematic study met the inclusion criteria.
WRIST CASTING FOR STABLE SCAPHOID FRACTURES
Recommended
Immobilization of the wrist with casting is moderately recommended for treatment of
documented stable scaphoid fractures which are displaced less than 1 mm, are non-oblique,
and do not include the proximal third of the scaphoid.
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence High
Indications
Stable documented scaphoid fractures that include fractures with any of these properties:
●
Fragments displaced less than 1mm;
●
Fragments are non-oblique;
●
Fragment does not include the proximal third of the scaphoid.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Casting should be performed for 6 to 8 weeks, and then with the cast removed, imaging
taken to assess healing (Vinnars et al., 2008, Leslie et al., 1981).
Rationale
There is no quality evidence comparing casting to no immobilization for scaphoid fractures.
However, in cadaveric studies there is a significant difference in angulation and rotation
when comparing casting with no-casting. There are 6 moderate-quality studies that include
casting as a treatment with effective results in achieving successful union reported
(McQueen et al., 2008, Vinnars et al., 2008, Dias et al., 2005, Clay et al., 1991, Gellman et al.,
1989, Saeden et al., 2001). Casting is not invasive, has some associated stiffness, decreased
grip strength, and atrophy due to disuse, and is of moderate cost; however, it is believed to
be essential to healing. It also has been associated with lower rates of subsequent
development of osteoarthrosis than operative fixation (Skirven et al., 1994). Thus, casting is
recommended for treatment of stable scaphoid fractures.

USE OF THUMB IMMOBILIZATION WITH CASTING FOR SCAPHOID FRACTURES
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against concurrent immobilization of the thumb with the
wrist for treatment of scaphoid fractures.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There is significant debate whether or not the thumb should be immobilized along with the
wrist. There is one moderate-quality study that found no advantage to using a thumb spica
compared with a Colles’ cast in 392 patients (Clay et al., 1991). Another study included
thumb immobilization in both groups when comparing long and short arm casts to evaluate
the effect of pronation and supination (Gellman et al., 1989). The authors concluded
inhibition of pronation and supination during the first 6 weeks was beneficial. However, in a
cadaveric model study, short arm casting was found to be just as effective as a thumb spica
(Schramm et al., 2008), in eliminating displacement and rotation of the fracture. Thus, there
is no evidence of improved healing rates or reduced rates of non-union between the two
types of cast, although thumb immobilization markedly reduces function (Brooks et al.,
2005, Clay et al., 1991, Cohen et al., 2001, London, 1961).

COLLES’ CASTING OR SUPPORTIVE BANDAGING FOR SUSPECTED BUT RADIOGRAPHICALLY
NEGATIVE SCAPHOID FRACTURE
Recommended
Colles’ casting or supportive bandaging is recommended for patients with suspicion of
scaphoid fracture, but with negative x-rays.

Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
2 weeks, followed by cast removal, clinical examination, and re-x-ray (Leslie et al., 1981,
Gumucio et al., 1989).
Rationale
The prognosis of occult fractures is thought to be very good as the fragments are by
definition, well approximated (McLaughlin et al., 1969, Leslie et al., 1981, Christodoulou et
al., 1986). For patients with suspicion of fractures, but negative x-rays, either Colles’ casting
or supportive bandaging (Sjolin et al., 1988) is recommended for 2 weeks, followed by cast
removal, clinical examination, and repeat x-ray (Gumucio et al., 1989, Leslie et al., 1981).
Reassessment in 2 weeks allows sufficient time for the fracture plane to be identifiable on
repeat x-rays. Casting or splinting in 2 weeks is generally sufficient to prevent significant
range of motion during the initial time the fracture would be healing and is recommended.
If x-rays are again negative and symptoms persist, it is unlikely that there is a fracture and
other diagnoses should be sought.

CASTING FOR HIGH-RISK SCAPHOID FRACTURES
Recommended
Long-arm casting at 90° of elbow flexion is recommended for high-risk scaphoid fractures
that are displaced 1mm or more (Cooney et al., 1980, Szabo et al., 1988), or fractures of the
proximal 1/3 of the scaphoid and oblique fractures (Leslie et al., 1981, Gumucio et al., 1989).
It is recommended that high-risk scaphoid fractures be evaluated and treated by a specialist
experienced in the management of these fractures.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
Scaphoid fractures are at a high risk for non-unions. High-risk scaphoid fractures have been
treated surgically for many years as they tend to not heal well, thus fixation is believed to
facilitate healing. While there are no quality studies supporting this belief, clinical
experiences indicate superior results with this approach. Surgical intervention is invasive,
has significant adverse effects including risk of non-union, and is costly. However, the risks
of not operating appear higher and surgery is recommended. For non-displaced fractures,
non-operative treatment is likely preferable, particularly as the long-term risk of
osteoarthrosis is lower.

SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Displaced fractures are believed to require surgical treatment with fixation, but there are no
quality studies of displaced fractures. Surgical treatment of non-displaced scaphoid
fractures has been evaluated in quality studies and there is no quality evidence of improved
long-term outcomes with surgery (655,659,662-666). These studies generally indicate earlier,
short-term functional recovery is achieved by surgery compared with prolonged casting
(657,662-665)
. A Swedish study also found higher costs among manual workers treated with
casts due to longer periods of lost time (666). However, two quality studies, one with 10-year
follow-up, demonstrated an 11-fold increased risk of scaphotrapezial osteoarthritis in those
surgically treated with internal fixation compared with those casted (655,662). Another study
noted a significant potential for overtreatment of these patients with surgery (665).
Indications to surgically fix a scaphoid fracture are not well defined, and there is a
suggestion that some patients are better candidates than others (e.g., widely displaced
fragments, or requirement for earlier recovery such as in professional athletes). Quality
evidence indicates operative treatment of non-displaced or minimally displaced scaphoid
fractures provide no long-term benefit in functional outcomes, and results in significantly
higher incidence of scaphotrapezial joint osteoarthritis. Until better quality evidence
becomes available, the decision to surgically treat a non-displaced scaphoid fracture is a
decision between the orthopedist and patient with a discussion suggested to include the
benefits of earlier functional recovery versus the longer term risks of osteoarthrosis.

Indications
Patients with non-displaced or minimally displaced scaphoid fractures who cannot or do not

also may include patients who are unable to work until the fracture is healed, thus electing
to forego attempted non-operative management and its attended lower risk of later
osteoarthrosis but longer course of immobilization in exchange for earlier return to work.
There is no significant evidence that one technique, including bone grafting is superior to
another (Braga-Silva et al., 2008, Caporrino et al., 2014, Garg et al., 2013, Raju et al., 2011,

Rationale
There is a small trial of osteogenic protein-1 (BMP-7) for treatment of 17 patients with

bone graft; 2) autologous iliac bone graft plus osteogenic protein-1; versus 3) allogenic iliac
bone graft plus osteogenic protein-1 (Bilic et al., 2006). The study reported the following
healing rates: sclerotic area at 3 months 138.3±15. 1 versus 74.0±14. 1 versus
103.6±13.2mm2, respectively. However, the results need repeating in a larger sample size
prior to a recommendation.
Evidence
There is 1 moderate-quality RCT incorporated into this analysis.

GANGLION CYSTS
OVERVIEW
Ganglion cysts occur in nearly any joint of the hand and wrist and have an estimated
prevalence rate of 14% (667), although prevalence rates based on MRIs are approximately
50%, with asymptomatic ganglia more likely to be volar (palmar) than dorsal (668).
Symptomatic onset is a common work-related claim, but quality studies linking ganglia with
work continue to be lacking. Wrist ganglia account for 50 to 70% of all wrist masses
identified (669). Other causes include giant cell tumors also known as localized nodular
tenosynovitis and fibrous xanthoma, epidermal inclusion cysts and fibromas. Wrist ganglia
are generally classified as either dorsal or palmar, with dorsal ganglia comprising up to 80%
and volar ganglia making up approximately 20% of clinically detected ganglia (670).
Approximately 10% of all hand and wrist ganglia are found on a flexor tendon sheath of the
fingers (671).
A ganglion is a cystic structure, although is not technically a cyst as it has no synovial lining
(672)
. Electron microscopy shows the walls to be composed of randomly oriented collagen
fibers. The gelatinous cystic fluid is likened to synovial fluid, although the composition of
hyaluronic acid, glucosamine, globulins, and albumin is not the same (672).
The pathogenesis of ganglia is unknown and the epidemiology sparse. Contributing factors
are also unknown. There are several theories of origin, although each has significant
weaknesses and none have been proven. These include the cyst being formed: 1) as a
simple herniation of the joint capsule; 2) as a result of an inflammatory process from
overuse; 3) as a tear in the joint capsule with subsequent release of synovial fluid and
subsequent reaction to the mucinous fluid; 4) as a result of mucoid degeneration of
adjacent extra-articular connective tissue; and 5) from joint stress causing mucin secretion
by mesenchymal cells in surrounding tissue (672-675). Each of these theories fails to wholly
explain all of the known facts, particularly because there seems to be no inflammatory
process.
Most ganglia present as a bump or mass. Occasionally patients with noticeable ganglia will
complain of mild nuisance pain, and less often of severe pain. In the assessment of wrist
pain in the absence of palpable ganglia, the unexplained wrist pain may be a result of occult
ganglia and should be included in the differential diagnosis. The pain from an occult dorsal
lesion has been linked to the compression of the posterior interosseous nerve (676). Ganglia
have also resulted in compression of the median and ulnar nerves as they pass through the
carpal tunnel and condylar groove respectively (see section on Ulnar Nerve Entrapment and
Elbow Disorders Guideline).
Wrist ganglia are usually well demarcated, firmly tethered, and have a consistency similar to
a rubber ball, and are translucent. Lack of translucency should raise suspicion of other
tumor type. The mass and surrounding skin should be inspected and palpated for erythema
and infection. Examination should also include close inspection for mass effect, including
neurovascular involvement, impairment of wrist or finger joint range of motion, impairment
of tendon function, and triggering. Small occult dorsal wrist ganglia may result in tenderness
over the scapholunate ligament and pain with hyperextension of the wrist (677).
Most wrist ganglia are asymptomatic. Many patient visits are primarily for aesthetic
reasons. A cross-sectional study of asymptomatic volunteers who underwent wrist MRI

revealed a ganglion prevalence rate of 51% (668). Symptomatic ganglia were more likely to be
volar (palmar) than dorsal (668).
Because of the natural course of spontaneous resolution and recurrence, follow-up should
be dictated by the course of treatment selected by the patient and physician.
There is no indication for limiting work activity except for ganglia that are causing significant
pain, as there is no reported strong association between activity and exacerbation or
causation of ganglia. Those with considerable pain may require limitations to avoid activities
provoking increased symptoms, most typically involving forceful use.
No quality epidemiological studies have shown work relatedness. In a cross-sectional survey
of more than 30,000 workers in the 1988 National Health Interview Survey, the prevalence
of clinical ganglion cyst was estimated at 14% (667). Of all cases, it was estimated based on
patient report of physician diagnosis that nearly 6% were attributed to work. However,
there were no analyses based on occupation or activity. There were no quality
epidemiologic studies addressing work place or occupational physical factors.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
There are no quality randomized trials for diagnostic testing in the evaluation of ganglia of
the upper extremity. Generally, diagnosis is based on physical examination findings.
Diagnosis is usually confirmed upon aspiration of mucinous fluid from the mass.
ROUTINE X-RAYS FOR DIAGNOSIS OF WRIST GANGLIA
Recommended
X-ray to diagnose dorsal or volar wrist ganglia in select patients is recommended.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Ganglia, especially occurring in the context of trauma where fracture may be present.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Obtaining x-rays once is generally sufficient.
Rationale
Patients develop ganglia for numerous reasons, ranging from trauma to arthritis to
idiopathic. The threshold for obtaining x-rays should be low. Patients incurring ganglia due
to trauma or other inciting events that may result in other traumatic sequelae such as
fractures, dislocations, and sprains, should have x-rays. Patients incurring ganglia through
non-traumatic means are candidates for initial management without x-rays. Some
practitioners advocate the use of x-rays for routine evaluation of all patients with dorsal or
volar wrist ganglia. However, there is no supporting evidence for this practice. In a
prospective case series of 103 patients with volar and dorsal ganglia, three view wrist

MRI FOR EVALUATION OF WRIST PAIN WITH SUSPECTED OCCULT DORSAL OR VOLAR
WRIST GANGLIA
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of MRI for the evaluation of wrist pain
with suspected occult dorsal or volar wrist ganglia as it may be of limited benefit in deciding
on the course of treatment.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
In a small study of 20 patients with suspected occult ganglia, an MRI was obtained prior to
surgical exploration and excision of the cyst. Comparison of MRI diagnosis with intraoperative findings and histological evaluation of the excised specimen resulted in MRI
scanning sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 50%, and a positive predictive value of 94%
(Goldsmith et al., 2008). The findings suggest in the absence of palpable mass, with no
history of trauma or other conditions such as arthritis, an MRI may be beneficial for the
diagnosis of occult symptomatic ganglia. However, in light of the results reported by Lowden
(Lowden et al., 2005), which found nearly half of the asymptomatic population have an
occult ganglia, the accuracy of these findings for screening purposes are questionable and
the utility of a positive result may be of less clinical consequence. MRI may be useful in
distinguishing synovitis from ganglion, which may be useful in determining the course of
treatment (Anderson et al., 2006). MRI is reasonable for patients who have had persistence
of pain consistent with a ganglion lasting at least 3 weeks without trending towards
improvement.

ULTRASOUND FOR EVALUATION OF CHRONIC WRIST PAIN WITH SUSPECTED OCCULT

No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of ultrasound for the evaluation of
chronic wrist pain with suspected occult dorsal or volar wrist ganglia. It may be beneficial in
select cases in deciding on the course of treatment.
Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

286

Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
In a small study of 57 patients with non-traumatic wrist pain and no palpable mass,
ultrasound was used to determine the presence of ganglia at the wrist – 33 patients (58%)
were found to have a ganglia of which 20 were treated with excision or aspiration and
improvement of symptoms after the intervention. As MRI has demonstrated the prevalence
of ganglia in asymptomatic study volunteers to be nearly 50% (Lowden et al., 2005), there is
likely a high probability of finding ganglia on ultrasound as well. Thus, a positive finding of
ganglion by ultrasound is of unknown clinical significance, particularly in that the study did
not provide long-term follow-up for all of the patients that were found to have a ganglion
cyst. If ultrasound is utilized, it would appear to be reasonable among patients who have
had persistence of pain lasting at least 3 weeks without trending towards improvement.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
INITIAL CARE
NON-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT (NO TREATMENT) FOR ACUTE ASYMPTOMATIC WRIST
AND HAND GANGLIA
Recommended
The use of non-operative management (no treatment) for acute asymptomatic wrist and
hand ganglia is recommended as first-line management as the natural history for
spontaneous resolution is more than 50%, and in recognition of the high recurrence rate of
most other treatment strategies.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

287

Rationale
There are many observational studies describing the natural history for ganglia to resolve
without any treatment over time. More than 50% are likely to resolve within months to
years. A recently published 6-year follow-up, reported a 58% spontaneous resolution rate in
patients that received no intervention (Dias et al., 2007). Thus, in the asymptomatic patient,
it is reasonable to provide patients reassurance that the mass is benign, and that the natural
course is for most to resolve without treatment, making waiting a reasonable trial.
However, patients may wish to have an intervention for cosmetic relief, and have reported
higher satisfaction despite the higher risk of surgical or interventional complications (Dias et
al., 2007).

EXERCISE FOR GANGLION CYSTS
Not Recommended
Exercise is not generally indicated acutely. For those with residual deficits, particularly postoperatively, see the recommendations for carpal tunnel syndrome.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operative, appointments should be scheduled
generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there has been functional improvement yet there are
ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is often helpful
(up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week appointments) may be
rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe, and there is ongoing
functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g., increased grip
strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities, increased duration
of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are appropriate when there is
evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent objective functional gain.
Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the therapy.

SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
ASPIRATION (WITHOUT OTHER INTERVENTION) FOR ACUTE COSMETIC AND GANGLIA
RELATED PAIN
Recommended
Aspiration (without other intervention) of the cystic fluid is recommended as it may result in
immediate relief of acute cosmetic and ganglia related pain.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
One aspiration is recommended (Latif et al., 2014). However, a long-term course of
aspiration is usually of no benefit in terms of resolution. There is no recommendation on
how many times aspiration should be attempted before advancing to other intervention.
Variants of simple aspiration include steroid injection, splinting, multiple punctures,
hyaluronidase, and sclerosing agents, reviewed below.
Rationale
Aspiration with instillation of steroids is the most common treatment for upper extremity
ganglia. Recurrence rates range from 14 to 83%. There are no quality studies that compare
simple aspiration with the addition of steroids; thus, no quality evidence to address whether
this results in potential benefits. However, a review of cohorts has shown an average
recurrence rate of 51% for aspiration alone, and a recurrence rate of 52% with aspiration
and steroids (Gude et al., 2008). As the cystic structure has been shown histologically and
with electron microscopy to have no synovial lining, but rather a network of collagenous
fiber layers, there is little theoretical reason to believe that steroid agents would result in
reducing inflammation, as there is theoretically no tissue in the cyst to be inflamed. There is
no recommendation for or against steroids when aspiration is used for immediate relief.

ASPIRATION WITH STEROIDS
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the addition of steroids with aspiration.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)

ASPIRATION AND MULTIPLE PUNCTURES OF CYST WALL

The technique of multiple punctures of the cyst wall is not recommended as it does not
provide improved benefit over simple aspiration.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

291

Rationale
There is one quality study comparing simple aspiration with multiple wall punctures
(Stephen et al., 1999), which did not show any significant difference in efficacy. A review of
non-RCT studies comparing aspiration with multiple punctures showed an average of 64%
recurrence rate, which is worse than aspiration alone (Gude et al., 2008). Thus, there is no
added benefit to making multiple punctures in the cystic wall, and may result in additional
skin trauma and higher risk of infection, making this intervention not recommended.

SPLINTING AFTER ASPIRATION FOR ACUTE OR SUBACUTE DORSAL OR VOLAR WRIST
GANGLIA
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of splinting after aspiration for the
treatment of acute or subacute dorsal or volar wrist ganglia as splinting may have uncertain
efficacy and may lead to prolonged joint stiffness.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies comparing immobilization as an adjunct treatment. In a
prospective series, immobilization after aspiration was not found to be of any significant
benefit compared those without immobilization in a 1-year prospective study of volar,
dorsal and digital ganglia (Korman et al., 1992). However, in an earlier study including
multiple punctures, immobilization had a positive effect for successful outcomes (Richman
et al., 1987). These conflicting results, in the absence of quality experimental data, preclude
making recommendation for or against this intervention.

HYALURONIDASE INSTILLATION AFTER ASPIRATION
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the instillation of hyaluronidase into the cystic
structure after aspiration.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
One moderate-quality study compared the standard therapy of aspiration and steroids with
the addition of hyaluronidase to the mixture (Paul et al., 1997). Although the study showed
a positive effect on the patient reporting for excellent results, it was not statistically
significant for good and excellent combined between the two groups. Thus, there is
insufficient evidence for recommendation for or against this intervention.

ASPIRATION AND SCLEROSING AGENTS
Not Recommended
Sclerosing agents (e.g., phenol, hypertonic saline), which when instilled are intended to
result in scarring and closure of the cystic potential space, are not recommended.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

293

Rationale
As the cystic structure as described histologically and with electron microscopy have
determined there is no synovial lining, rather a network of collagenous layers, there is little
theoretical reason to believe that sclerosing agents would result in inciting an inflammatory
reaction. In one small prospective study of 29 patients in Africa, 2cc of hypertonic saline
injected into the cyst structure after aspiration was reported to result in only one
recurrence after a 2-year follow-up (Dogo et al., 2003). A small study of 10 patients treated
with phenol injection was reported with good results (Park et al., 2002). From anatomic
studies, it has been shown that the cystic structure is connected to the synovial space in
some cysts, so that there is some theoretical risk that instilling sclerosing agents will directly
enter into a joint with resultant poor consequences. Thus, these therapies are only reported
in small studies with higher risk of causing harm, and are not recommended.

SURGICAL EXCISION FOR SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC UPPER EXTREMITY GANGLIA
Recommended
Surgical intervention is recommended for treatment of subacute or chronic upper extremity
ganglia after a trial of non-operative management.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
Surgical intervention is the most effective treatment method for upper extremity ganglia
despite the significant recurrence rates and higher risk of complications (Limpaphayom et
al., 2004, Latif et al., 2014, Khan et al., 2011, Head et al., 2015, Tadjerbashi et al., 2014). As
most upper extremity ganglia are asymptomatic, consideration of surgical risks and a trial of
non-operative management are prudent before performing a surgical procedure for
cosmetic reasons. One moderate-quality study exists comparing the recurrence rates of
surgery to aspiration with steroids (Limpaphayom et al., 2004). With a sample size of 28
dorsal ganglia, the success rate at 6 months was significantly higher with surgery (82% vs.
38%, p <0. 05). The generalizability of the study is limited because of the small sample and

the exclusion of other ganglia types. The success of surgery reported in non-randomized
prospective case series suggest an overall recurrence rate between 5% and 40%. More
recent surgical techniques that include comprehensive dissection and excision of the cyst,
pedicle, and a cuff of the adjacent joint capsule are believed to have better results (Gude et
al., 2008).

ARTHROSCOPIC VERSUS OPEN EXCISION
Recommended
There is no general indication for one surgical technique (arthroscopic or open excision)
over another for all cases and both are recommended. There may be advantages of
arthroscopic procedures for ganglia originating in the radiocarpal joints, whereas open
excision may have advantages in ganglia originating in midcarpal joints, although both have
the same success rate.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are two moderate-quality studies comparing open excision to arthroscopic resection
of wrist ganglia. In both studies, rates of recurrence were low and not significantly different
(Kang et al., 2008, Rocchi et al., 2008), thus showing no clear advantage for either
technique. However, when comparing outcomes results for lost time, complications and
functionality, arthroscopic excision of radiocarpal ganglia had faster recovery time and
fewer complications than open excision, whereas open excision had better recovery and
fewer complications than arthroscopic excision for midcarpal ganglia (Rocchi et al., 2008).
However, these conclusions are weakened by small sample size and lack of statistical
analyses to make recommendation for or against difficult. In a non-randomized trial (Rizzo
et al., 2004), the effectiveness of arthroscopic excision of dorsal ganglia in a 2-year follow-up
study demonstrated 5% recurrence, although failure with arthroscopy was treated with
open excision.

HAND-ARM VIBRATION SYNDROME

the constellation of adverse physiological responses causally associated with high-amplitude
vibratory forces, such as those experienced through the use of various hand tools including
pneumatic drills, riveters and chain saws (678-680) or from vibratory rich activities such as
driving off-road vehicles (681). Other terms commonly used to describe these responses
include Raynaud’s phenomenon of occupational origin, white fingers, dead fingers,
traumatic vasospastic disease (TVD), and “vibration-induced white finger” (682).
The adverse effects of HAVS are characterized by circulatory disturbances associated with
digital arteriole sclerosis and manifest as vasospasm with local finger blanching; sensory and
motor disturbances manifest as numbness, loss of finger coordination and dexterity,
clumsiness and inability to perform intricate tasks; and musculoskeletal disturbances
manifest as swelling of the fingers, bone cysts and vacuoles (683,684). There are also several
reports of association of CTS with HAVS and exposure to vibration (683,685-688).
Initial assessment for HAVS is a detailed history and examination focusing particularly on
high-amplitude vibratory exposure and sensorineural or vascular symptoms. The clinical
symptoms may include episodic tingling, numbness, blanching white fingers, pain and
paresthesia, burning sensation, clumsiness, poor coordination, sleep disturbance, hand
weakness measured in grip strength, and diffuse muscle, bone and joint pain from the
fingers to the elbow (496). Differential diagnosis should consider other causes of Raynaud’s
phenomenon, including the connective tissue diseases of scleroderma, systemic lupus
erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis, and polyarteritis nodosa.
A complete examination should include close attention to motor, sensory and vascular
functions of the affected extremities. Evaluation should be extended to the shoulder and
neck for upper extremity symptoms including tests for vascular insufficiency. Particular note
should be made for blanching, coordination of movement, grip strength, tenderness and
swelling of the digits and forearm tissue, and trophic changes of the skin. The value of cold
provocation or neurophysiological tests in the diagnosis is controversial (689,690).

Many patients require no follow-up appointments as the main thrust of the initial treatment
generally focuses on securing the diagnosis and initiating treatment. Patients may require a
few follow-up appointments, depending on severity and need for workplace limitations.
Epidemiologic evidence indicates there is a latency period of from 1 to 16 years of exposure
before onset of HAVS, with a trend for decreasing prevalence as changes in work-practice
and anti-vibratory tools and dampening actions have been implemented (691). The direct
pathophysiological basis for the observed vascular responses of HAVS is not known, but
several theories are proposed including vibration causing direct trauma to smooth muscle
and smooth muscle vacuoles (692), vascular spasm related to activation of alpha-2
adrenoreceptor in the vessel walls (693), or the release of a potent vasoconstrictor known as
salivary endothelin (694). The pathophysiology of neurologic deficits is also unknown, but
presumably is related to vibration induced microvascular changes and demylelination (691).
The pathophysiologic changes related to vibration are initially reversible, but with increasing
duration and intensity of exposure, the disorder may continue to progress or become
permanent (695). According to the International Organization for Standardization, the risk for
developing HAVS is proportional to the total vibration energy measured in magnitude,
duration, and frequency (696). The range of vibration frequencies thought to be harmful is
4Hz to 5000Hz (683,686,697) dependent on the intensity, and whether or not it is oscillatory or
impact force, with impact vibratory force thought to be more hazardous. There are several
exposure limit guidelines for vibration, including for the United States (52,698,699). There are
other guidelines adopted in the UK and Japan. There is limited epidemiological data to
better define the exposure-response relationships for each of the various components of
HAVS, however, recent animal models provide some insights into exposure-response
patterns (27,35,697,700).
Work-relatedness is based on confirmation of the diagnosis and a mechanism of
occupational injury where there is an appropriate exposure which is generally low frequency
high amplitude vibration.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Currently there is no “gold standard” for the diagnosis and staging of hand-arm vibration
syndrome (HAVS). Most authorities have adopted the Stockholm workshop scale (701,702)
which is subjective and relies on patient recall (703). This subjective system presents
problems with reliability, particularly from patients pursuing compensation claims, which
has been demonstrated in at least one study of persons reporting HAVS-related Raynaud’s
phenomenon and submitting photographs of their hands during an active episode for
review. Approximately 50% of the study population that reported to have captured their
episode did not have supporting photographic evidence for what they were reporting (704).
In the pursuit of objective testing, there are a number of reported physical methods that
attempt to provide measurable physiologic changes to support the diagnosis of HAVS. For
measurement of vascular changes, the cold provocation test (CPT) has long been a cited
maneuver. CPT is conducted by immersing the hands in water at 10° C-15° C for 10 minutes,
and comparing skin temperature recovery at 5 and 10 minutes with baseline prior to the
cold water bath. The observer also looks for signs of blanching or white finger. There are
several variations of this technique, which include adding more sophisticated temperature
measurement instruments for measurement of finger skin temperature (FST) changes, or
thermographic studies such as with infrared and dynamic infrared imaging. Finger systolic

blood pressure (FSBP) measurement has also been described. Each of these tests attempts
to reproduce or measure vascular changes associated with cooling (705-709). Neurological
testing has also been described through various methods. Most include measurement of
sensory and motor functions, rather than nerve conduction or EMG studies. These tests
include vibrotactile threshold tests, thermal aesthesiometry, grip strength, and dexterity
testing.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES FOR HAND-ARM VIBRATION SYNDROME
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of a cold provocation test, cold stress
thermography (finger skin temperature, infrared, dynamic infrared, laser Doppler imaging),
finger systolic blood pressure, vibrotactile threshold testing, thermal aesthesiometry, or
nerve conduction velocity studies to diagnose hand arm vibration syndrome (HAVS).
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
Despite the widespread acceptance of physiologic testing, there are no quality RCTs
comparing the utility of diagnostic methods for HAVS. Furthermore, there is poor
correlation of these various physiological tests with the Stockholm workshop scales
(Thompson et al., 2008), and a general inability of these tests to reliably differentiate HAVS
from controls (Poole et al., 2006, Poole et al., 2004).
A recent review of the literature concluded that there does not appear to be any single test
with satisfactory diagnostic capability in diagnosing HAVS (white finger), but supports the
use of cold provocation testing (CPT) as reasonable (Harada et al., 2008). However, a large
scale review of cold provocation testing in over 40,000 UK miners being evaluated for
compensation claims found only slight correlation of self-reported clinical severity and CPT
results, concluding that CPT should not be used for evaluating the vascular component of
HAVS (Proud et al., 2003). There remains no established standard for CPT methodology,
which makes interpretation and comparisons difficult. While the test is relatively benign and
inexpensive, the results are of unknown diagnostic utility.
There is little information available supporting the utility of thermographic imaging. Most of
the reports are of small populations. The most recent study (21 patients) concluded that
none of the available methods is sufficient for arterial constriction testing, but may be
useful in follow-up testing of individuals (Jankovic et al., 2008). A similar story exists for
finger systolic blood pressure monitoring as a diagnostic test. A recent prospective study
measuring the changes in finger systolic blood pressure (FSBP) after segmental local cooling
for vibration-induced white finger in vibration exposed vs. non-exposed populations showed
a significant decrease in FSBP in the exposed group with reported HAVS vs. non-exposed as
well as the exposed with no history of HAVS. The sensitivity and specificity of the FSBP test
with a cut-off value of 75% of normal at 23 +/- 1 degrees C, were 65. 2 and 87. 5%,
respectively, and at 21 +/- 1 degrees C, they were 73. 9 and 82. 5%, respectively (Kurozawa

et al., 1991). However, the study used self-report of HAVS and included retired (no longer
exposed) persons in the exposed with HAVS group.
Testing for neurological deficits may be slightly more beneficial than vascular testing for
confirming the severity of nerve damage associated with HAVS, although they are not
definitive in objectively identifying HAVS. In a follow-up report of UK miners being evaluated
for HAVS claims, 57,000 persons evaluated with vibrotactile threshold testing and thermal
aesthesiometry showed some evidence that these tests are reliable indicators of underlying
neurological damage (McGeoch et al., 2004).
Thus, there is insufficient evidence for making evidence based recommendations on the
utility of each of the various tests currently available for the vascular and neurological
components of HAVS. Administering a combination of these tests may improve the
diagnostic utility when considered in context of the medical history and occupational
exposures. Nerve conduction studies may also be indicated to rule out other associated or
concomitant upper extremity disorders, although are not likely of useful benefit for
diagnosis of HAVS. In addition to neurovascular physiologic testing, there are limited reports
of serologic testing for HAVS.

Rationale
There are no quality randomized studies on the utility of serologic testing or connective

currently provide objective evidence or staging of HAVS. Objective serum tests, such as
levels of soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(sICAM-1), may provide some utility in the future as they have been shown to be statistically
different in exposed groups with HAVS symptoms, but the usefulness is hampered currently
by the lack of clear reference ranges (Kao et al., 2008), as each of the measurements for
both comparison groups were still in the range considered normal. Testing for other causes
of Raynaud’s phenomenon, particularly connective tissue disorders such as scleroderma and
systemic lupus erythematosus may be beneficial when occupational exposure histories are
not consistent with clinical presentation and the threshold for such testing should be low.

by the lack of clear reference ranges (Kao et al., 2008), as each of the measurements for
both comparison groups were still in the range considered normal. Testing for other causes
of Raynaud’s phenomenon, particularly connective tissue disorders such as scleroderma and
systemic lupus erythematosus may be beneficial when occupational exposure histories are
not consistent with clinical presentation and the threshold for such testing should be low.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
There are no quality randomized clinical studies for the treatment of physiologic
manifestations associated with HAVS. The most prudent form of treatment is to first remove
or reduce the exposure to vibration, particularly in the earlier stages of symptom
presentation. There are no quality studies of medications that prevent or improve
symptoms related to HAVS. As the vascular component of HAVS mimics other causes of
Raynaud’s phenomenon, calcium channel antagonists, which have positive benefit for many
with non-vibration related cases, are often prescribed for HAVS.
AVOIDANCE OF RISK FACTORS (INCLUDING VIBRATION EXPOSURE AND SMOKING) FOR
HAND-ARM VIBRATION SYNDROME
Recommended
The avoidance of risk factors, including removal/reduction of the exposure to vibration and
smoking cessation, is recommended for individuals with hand-arm vibration syndrome
(HAVS).
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality randomized clinical studies for the treatment of physiologic
manifestations associated with HAVS. The most prudent form of treatment is to first remove
or reduce the exposure to vibration, particularly in the earlier stages of symptom
presentation.
Smoking has been identified as a risk factor for HAVS . By inference, smoking cessation is a
frequent recommendation to patients with HAVS. The effects of smoking on HAVS, if any,
are thought to be a result of chronic platelet function inhibition (Nowak et al., 1996), effects
on the microvasculature and that of nicotine on smooth muscle function. However, there is
no quality evidence that smoking cessation will affect the course. As a risk factor, smoking
cessation is recommended.
Other common advice based on the proposed pathophysiology of vasospasm includes
avoidance of beta-blockers, sympathetic stimulants including caffeine, decongestants,
amphetamines and even cocaine as they may act as potential triggers. Further, maintenance
of hand and body temperature in cold environments may help avoid or reduce the risk of
symptoms.

VIBRATION EXPOSURE WORK RESTRICTIONS FOR HAND-ARM VIBRATION SYNDROME
Recommended
Restricting work to tasks that do not involve high-amplitude, low-frequency vibration
exposures from hand-held tools is recommended for patients with hand-arm vibration
syndrome (HAVS).
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
HAVS from high-amplitude, low-frequency vibration exposures through vibrating hand-held
tools.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution or desire of the patient to remove limitations. If the exposure(s) are confirmed
and the clinical findings are significant, re-exposure is not believed to be indicated.
Rationale
Limitation of exposure to total vibration dose should be achieved particularly by limiting the
duration and frequency to high-amplitude, low-frequency vibration. Reducing transmission
of vibration through isolation and damping techniques may also be attempted, although in a
patient with established HAVS, avoidance is generally preferable. Avoidance of cold
temperatures that provoke symptoms or wearing gloves if sufficient to control symptoms is
warranted (Pelmear et al., 2000). Anti-vibration gloves are sometimes utilized. Recognition
and reduction of other ergonomic factors including repeated and sustained exertion,
forceful exertions, contact stress, and stressful postures may be helpful.
COLD EXPOSURE WORK RESTRICTIONS FOR HAVS
Sometimes Recommended
Restricting work to tasks that do not involve cold exposure is recommended for select
patients with hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS).
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
HAVS that is not controlled through avoidance of vibration exposures, or patients having
recurring problems with vasospasm or other complications that are unresolved with other
treatments.

CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS FOR ADVANCED SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC HAND-ARM
VIBRATION SYNDROME
Recommended
Use of calcium channel blockers (nifedipine) for treatment of vascular symptoms similar to
Raynaud’s phenomenon is recommended for advanced subacute or chronic hand-arm
vibration syndrome (HAVS).
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Patients with HAVS. Generally used in patients with sufficient symptoms such that removal
from exposure is insufficient for management.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Per manufacturer’s recommendations; generally initiated with low dose. Blood pressure
should be monitored and may require lower doses, especially among those without higher
blood pressures or among those with adverse effects.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution, intolerance, adverse effects.
Rationale
There is no quality evidence for the use of calcium channel blockers in HAVS population. It is
a commonly accepted treatment for Raynaud’s phenomenon associated with connective
tissue diseases with moderate benefit. A review of all calcium channel antagonist trials for
non-HAVS Raynaud’s is beyond the scope of this text. Rather, as this medication is already

EXERCISE FOR HAND-ARM VIBRATION SYNDROME
Sometimes Recommended
Exercise is selectively recommended for patients with hand-arm vibration syndrome (see
below).
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Exercise is not generally indicated. In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operative,
appointments should be scheduled generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there has been
functional improvements yet there are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional
set of 5-6 appointments is often helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more
than once a week appointments) may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits
were more severe, and there is ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of
a set of visits (e.g., increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing
work abilities, increased duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments
are appropriate when there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised
absent objective functional gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with
the therapy.
Rationale
There are no quality studies incorporated into this analysis.

HAND AND FINGER OSTEOARTHROSIS
OVERVIEW
Hand and finger osteoarthrosis is extraordinarily common, affecting over 50% of the aged
population. It is believed to be largely non-occupational (710,711), but some cases may be
covered under certain workers’ compensation jurisdictions, usually under fairly limited
circumstances. This is particularly true for monoarticular arthrosis as a consequence of an
occupational injury.
Most cases of osteoarthrosis are believed to result from genetic factors, although discrete
trauma is a potential cause. The initial assessment is usually relatively concise and generally
involves securing a diagnosis and initiating treatment. Patients usually have no recalled
acute traumatic event. A minority have a history of significant trauma, such as a fracture or
dislocation. Regardless of cause, symptoms usually consist of gradual onset of stiffness and
non-radiating pain. Gradual joint enlargement is often present, although frequently
unnoticed by the patient. Swelling, erythema, warmth and other signs of infection or
inflammation are not present, and if present signal an inflammatory, crystalline arthropathy,
septic arthritis or other cause. The history should include symptoms affecting any other
joints in the body, presence of other potential causes (e.g., psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis,
gout) to help ascertain the correct diagnosis.
Mild cases may show few, if any abnormalities. However, as the disease progresses, more
findings develop. Boney enlargement of the affected joint(s) is present on inspection and
range of motion is usually reduced. The most commonly affected joint is the thumb
carpometacarpal (CMC) joint, which may become enlarged and deformed. Boney
enlargement of the distal interphalangeal joints is termed “Heberden’s nodes” while of the
proximal interphalangeal joints is called “Bouchard’s nodes.” Crepitus on range of motion is
often present. Joints are generally not warm, have no significant joint effusion and are
usually non-tender.
Many patients require no follow-up appointments as the main thrust of the initial treatment
generally focuses on securing the diagnosis and initiating treatment. Some patients may
require a few follow-up appointments, depending on severity and need for workplace
limitations.
Hand osteoarthrosis generally requires no work limitations. When the disease progresses to
moderate or severe disease, work limitations may be required due to the impairment and or
pain.

There is one cross sectional study from the textile industry that suggests some cases of hand
osteoarthrosis may have a component of occupational tasks (712); however, those jobs are
likely no longer present in the U. S. In most patients, multiple joints are symmetrically
affected. Yet, occupational exposures are frequently not symmetrical and do not explain this
association, thus these cases are usually believed to be non-occupational. However, there
are cases of monoarticular osteoarthrosis occurring in a joint affected by a remote,
traumatic event such as a fracture involving the joint or adjacent to the joint, dislocation or
significant sprain. Work-relatedness of those cases is generally non-controversial as it is
believed to be a consequence of the acute traumatic event.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
For most purposes, a history and physical examination is sufficient but sometimes x-rays are
used. X-rays are sometimes used in medicolegal situations to document the degree and
extent of involvement. However, x-rays can be negative in those with osteoarthrosis as well
as show evidence of disease among those asymptomatic.
X-RAYS TO EVALUATE HAND OSTEOARTHROSIS
Recommended
X-rays are recommended to define objective evidence of the extent of hand osteoarthrosis.

Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating x-rays for hand osteoarthrosis. Most patients do not
require x-rays for diagnosis and can be managed clinically. However, in some cases, x-rays
are helpful and may assist in some patients in diagnosing and treating the condition. Thus, xrays are recommended for hand osteoarthrosis.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
INITIAL CARE
Relative rest, splints, ice, and heat have been utilized for treatment of hand osteoarthrosis
(713-715)
. Uncontrolled trials have reported splinting reduced the need for hand surgery
(433,716)
. Exercises have been recommended as well (715,717-722).
RELATIVE REST FOR CHRONIC HAND OSTEOARTHROSIS
Not Recommended
Relative rest is not recommended for chronic hand osteoarthrosis.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies of this treatment. Relative rest does not appear to improve the
disease in any other joint in the body (see Hip and Groin Disorders Guideline), and instead
may promote debility. Thus, while not invasive, potential adverse effects may occur.
Although it is generally low cost provided the patient is able to continue to work, it is not
recommended.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: Rest, Hand,
Fingers, Thumb, Metacarpus, Osteoarthritis, Osteoarthrosis; controlled clinical trial,

sources. Zero articles met the inclusion criteria.
SPLINTING FOR ACUTE FLARES OR CHRONIC HAND OSTEOARTHROSIS
Recommended
Splinting is recommended for acute flares or chronic hand osteoarthrosis.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Hand osteoarthrosis symptoms insufficiently treated with NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and/or
topical medications. Prefabricated or custom-made orthoses may be utilized.

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

307

Rationale
All quality studies of splinting addressed thumb CMC/trapeziometacarpal OA. There is one
quality study evaluating splinting versus no splinting that suggested modest benefits
(Rannou et al., 2009), although that trial may have been biased by a non-interventional
control. Two crossover trials of different splints suggest a flexible splint or support across
the thumb CMC joint is superior to other, more rigid splint options (Buurke et al., 1999,
Weiss et al., 2004). A fourth study compared two different exercise and splint regimens and
found no differences (Wajon et al., 2005); thus, whether splints are beneficial compared
with no splint is unclear. Splinting, particularly with a soft elastic support, is not invasive, has
few adverse effects, is generally low cost and thus is recommended.

EXERCISE FOR ACUTE FLARES OR CHRONIC HAND OSTEOARTHROSIS
Recommended
Exercise is recommended for treatment of acute flares or chronic hand osteoarthrosis.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Hand osteoarthrosis symptoms insufficiently treated with NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and/or
topical medications.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
One or 2 appointments for teaching home exercises. An additional subsequent appointment
or two a few weeks later may be helpful to reinforce exercises and techniques. In the event
it is needed for recovery or post-operative, appointments should be scheduled generally
weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there have been functional improvements yet there are
ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is often helpful
(up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week appointments) may be

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

308

rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe, and there is ongoing
functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g., increased grip
strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities, increased duration
of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are appropriate when there is
evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent objective functional gain.
Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the therapy.
Rationale
Exercise has not been widely investigated for treatment of hand OA, but has not been found
to be harmful for hip or knee osteoarthritis patients (see Hip and Groin Disorders Guideline)
and those patients obtain superior benefits with active exercise, and by inference may
suggest rest is not appropriate for hand osteoarthrosis patients. One quality study found a
home exercise program performed daily after a single 30-minute training session superior to
educational controls for treatment of hand osteoarthrosis (Stamm et al., 2002). An
uncontrolled trial found strength training increased grip strength and reduced pain(Rogers
et al., 2007); however, a subsequent moderate-quality crossover trial by the same
researcher did not find an exercise regimen of range of motion and strengthening exercises
superior to another (Rogers et al., 2009). As well, a study of combined exercises and splints
failed to find one program superior (Wajon et al., 2005). However, it is possible the trial by
Rogers et al that evaluated exercises placed emphasis on flexibility exercises, thus biasing
towards the null when additional trials may demonstrate clinically meaningful results.
Exercises are not invasive, have low adverse effects, and are low cost after an appointment
or two for teaching purposes and are recommended.

SELF-APPLICATION OF HEAT FOR ACUTE FLARES OR CHRONIC HAND OSTEOARTHROSIS
Recommended
Self-application of heat is recommended for acute flares or chronic hand osteoarthrosis.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low

Indications
Hand osteoarthrosis symptoms insufficiently treated with NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and/or
topical medications.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Self-applications of heat, most commonly 15 to 20 minutes, 3 to 5 times a day.
Rationale
There are no quality studies of this treatment. Most patients find heat superior to
cryotherapies; however, there are no quality studies of either for treatment of hand OA.
Heat may help with symptomatic relief, is not invasive, has no adverse effects, is not costly
when self-applied and thus is recommended.
SELF-APPLICATION OF ICE FOR CHRONIC HAND OSTEOARTHROSIS
Not Recommended
Self-application of ice is not recommended for chronic hand osteoarthrosis.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies of this treatment. Most patients find heat superior to

MEDICATIONS
NSAIDs and acetaminophen are widely used to treat pain associated with osteoarthrosis
(OA), and are considered highly efficacious, although most studies evaluating their use
lasted not longer than 6 weeks (723-726). Most quality studies evaluated NSAIDs and
acetaminophen in hip and/or knee OA patients and some evaluated low back pain patients

(see Hip and Groin Disorders and Low Back Disorders Guidelines). Few have evaluated hand
osteoarthrosis patients (727,728,729).
NSAIDS FOR ACUTE FLARES, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC HAND OSTEOARTHROSIS
Recommended
NSAIDs are moderately recommended to control pain associated with acute flares,
subacute, or chronic hand osteoarthrosis.
[Evidence is robust and strongly recommended for the treatment of osteoarthrosis in other
body regions – Strongly Recommended, Evidence (A) (see Hip and Groin Disorders
guideline). Evidence is also present for efficacy of these agents for treating symptoms from
OA flares (see Hip and Groin Disorders guideline).
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence High
Rationale
There is abundant quality evidence that COX-1 and COX-2 NSAIDs improve pain and produce
higher functional status among chronic osteoarthrosis patients (see Hip and Groin Disorders
Guideline), and two quality studies included hand OA patients. There are a few studies of
osteoarthrosis flares that also consistently document benefits, although not involving hand
OA patients. There are many quality trials comparing the various NSAIDs; however, there is
no consistent quality evidence of superiority of one over another or of one class over
another class. There is one quality study suggesting that evening dosing of indomethacin
results in better pain control, but the study has not been replicated (Levi et al., 1985) and
there is no similar result with the longer half-life agent celecoxib (Stengaard-Pedersen et al.,
2004). There is quality evidence that NSAIDs are less impairing than opioids, yet with
comparable efficacy (see Chronic Pain and Low Back Disorders guidelines).
Quality evidence documents NSAIDs as superior to acetaminophen for symptomatic relief of
OA (see the Chronic Pain. Low Back Disorders, and Hip and Groin Disorders guidelines)
(Boureau et al., 2004, Bradley et al., 1991, Case et al., 2003, Geba et al., 2002, Golden et al.,
2004, Pincus et al., 2001, Temple et al., 2006, Towheed, 2006). However, quality evidence
also indicates higher rates of gastrointestinal adverse effects among NSAID users and
generally lower overall adverse effects profiles for acetaminophen, providing rational for
utilization of acetaminophen to treat some patients, particularly the elderly and others
prone to GI complications.
NSAIDs are not invasive, have low side effect profiles in a healthy working-age patient
population, and are low cost when generic medications are used. The potential for NSAIDs
to increase the risk of cardiovascular events needs to be carefully considered in patients and
will likely require additional quality studies to fully address. Acetaminophen is a
recommended alternative, particularly for first-line treatment or for patients at increased
risk for GI complications. These medications are recommended.

RISK ASSESSMENT FOR ADVERSE EVENTS FROM CHRONIC NSAID USE
Recommended
Risk of adverse events from chronic NSAID use should be incorporated, especially including
risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
Strength of evidence Strongly Recommended, Evidence (A)
Level of confidence High
Indications
For hand osteoarthrosis patients, NSAIDs and acetaminophen are recommended for
treatment. Over-the-counter agents may suffice and may be tried first.
Rationale
Quality evidence documents NSAIDs as superior to acetaminophen for symptomatic relief of
OA (see the Chronic Pain. Low Back Disorders, and Hip and Groin Disorders guidelines) .
However, quality evidence also indicates higher rates of gastrointestinal adverse effects
among NSAID users and generally lower overall adverse effects profiles for acetaminophen,
providing rational for utilization of acetaminophen to treat some patients, particularly the
elderly and others prone to GI complications.
Risk assessment should particularly include: prior history of gastrointestinal bleeding and
source, length of treatment, age, smoking, diabetes mellitus and other medical factors. It is
strongly recommended that patients with greater risk should be considered for treatment
with either acetaminophen, NSAID plus misoprostol, proton pump inhibitors or a COX-2
selective agent (see Hip and Groin Disorders Guideline) (Berenbaum et al., 2005, Garner et
al., 2005). While COX-2 selective agents have generally been recommended as either third-

314

or fourth-line medications for routine use in osteoarthrosis patients, when there is a risk of
gastrointestinal complications, they are often preferred. Proton pump inhibitors and
misoprostol are also gastro-protective and have quality evidence of efficacy and are
recommended (see Hip and Groin Disorders Guideline), while there is substantially less
evidence in support of sucralfate. COX-2 selective agents may still be used for those with
contraindications to other medications, especially those with a history of gastrointestinal
bleeding or past history of peptic ulcer disease. For patients at high risk of gastrointestinal
bleeding, there is evidence that a combination of proton pump inhibitor plus COX-2
selective agent is efficacious. Should rofecoxib become available, it is suggested that it be
considered as a fourth- or fifth-line medication for treatment of osteoarthrosis, likely paired
with low-dose aspirin, and be positioned as a second-line medication for those with
contraindications for the first- and second-line medication and in whom acetaminophen and
celecoxib appear ineffective.

NSAIDS FOR PATIENTS AT RISK FOR GI ADVERSE EFFECTS
Recommended
Concomitant prescriptions of cytoprotective medications are strongly recommended for
patients at substantially increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. There are four
commonly used cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, double-dose
histamine Type 2 receptor blockers (famotidine, ranitindine, cimetadine, etc.), and proton
pump inhibitors (esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole).
There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of
gastrointestinal bleeding (Graham et al., 2002), although evidence for sucralfate is limited.
There also are combination products of NSAIDs/misoprostol that have documented
reductions in risk of endoscopic lesions (see Hip and Groin Disorders Guideline).
Strength of evidence Strongly Recommended, Evidence (A)
Level of confidence High

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

315

Indications
For patients with a high-risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs,
cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer-term treatment is
contemplated. At-risk patients include those with a history of prior gastro-intestinal
bleeding, the elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
As recommended.
Indications for discontinuation
Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAIDs.

DISCUSSION REGARDING NSAIDS FOR PATIENTS AT RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR ADVERSE
EFFECTS
Recommended
Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular
disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Frequency/Dose/Duration
If needed, NSAIDs that are non-selective are preferred over COX-2 specific drugs. In patients
receiving low-dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to
minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, the
NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin (Antman
et al., 2007).

TOPICAL NSAIDS FOR HAND OSTEOARTHROSIS
Recommended
Topical NSAIDs are recommended to control pain associated with hand osteoarthrosis.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
Topical NSAIDs have been widely used. There are two quality studies are single-application
studies precluding an evaluation is a regular treatment regimen, although they do suggest
weak efficacy (Rothacker et al., 1994, Rothacker et al., 1998). Thus, there are not quality
studies, and they appear to have quality evidence of efficacy for conditions with target
tissue that is close to the skin, such as lateral epicondylitis (see Elbow Disorders Guideline)
which is analogous to the skin in the dorsal hands. These medications are generally well
tolerated, have few adverse effects, and are not costly when generic prescriptions are used,
although they can be costly with name-brand prescription use over time. These medications
are recommended.

Excessive burning of the skin or other intolerance. Not recommended for continual use,
rather periods without use have been recommended.
Rationale
There is one quality study of capsaicin for treatment of these patients and it suggests
benefits over a 4-week trial (McCarthy et al., 1992). Thus, it is recommended.

YOGA FOR CHRONIC HAND OSTEOARTHROSIS OR ACUTE FLARES OF OSTEOARTHROSIS
Recommended
Yoga is recommended for treatment of chronic hand osteoarthrosis or acute flares of
osteoarthrosis.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Hand osteoarthrosis pain in motivated patients.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Self-directed program after up to 8 supervised sessions (Garfinkel et al., 1994).
Indications for discontinuation
Intolerance, non-compliance.
Rationale
There is one low-quality study of yoga that suggested benefits (Garfinkel et al., 1994). As
yoga is not invasive, has few adverse effects, and is low cost, it is recommended for select,
motivated patients.

COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC HAND OSTEOARTHROSIS
OR ACUTE FLARES
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against use of glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, methylsulfonyl methane, diacerein (diacerhein, diacetylrhein), harpagophytum, avocado soybean
unsaponifiables, ginger, oral enzymes, nettle leaf, or rose hips for treatment of chronic hand
osteoarthrosis or acute flares.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are more than 30 quality studies reviewed in the Hip and Groin Disorders Guideline.
The largest volume of studies addresses glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate. This quality
literature mostly addresses hip or knee osteoarthrosis or low back pain. Of the 5 quality,
double-blinded studies that used x-rays for evaluation of glucosamine/chondroitin, three
have documented delayed progression of joint space narrowing. There are 3 low-quality
studies of chondroitin sulfate for treatment of hand arthrosis with one suggesting delay of
hand x-ray changes (Rovetta et al., 2002). Yet, there are quality studies of knee and hip OA
that have been both sizable and negative. However, glucosamine and chondroitin have
problems with lack of standardization of doses. Nettle leaf (Randall et al., 2000) has an
additional problem of relative unavailability. This problem affects the other, less studied
agents in this group of treatments. Consequently, although these agents are not invasive,
have low adverse effects profiles, and may be costly over time, there is no recommendation
for or against these agents.

LOW-LEVEL LASER THERAPY FOR HAND OSTEOARTHROSIS
Not Recommended
Low-level laser therapy is moderately not recommended for treatment of hand
osteoarthrosis.
Strength of evidence Moderately Not Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There is one high-quality study that suggests low-level laser therapy is ineffective for
treatment of hand osteoarthrosis (Brosseau et al., 2005). Low-level laser therapy is not
invasive and has low adverse effects, but it is costly. Thus, in the absence of efficacy, it is not
recommended.

INJECTION THERAPY
Intraarticular glucocorticosteroid and hyaluronidate injections are sometimes performed to
attempt to deliver medication with minimal systemic effects to the arthritic joint (733-741),
particularly when acetaminophen and NSAIDs have failed. These injections are generally
performed without fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance in the distal upper extremity.
INTRAARTICULAR GLUCOCORTICOSTEROID INJECTION FOR SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC HAND
OSTEOARTHROSIS
Recommended
Intraarticular glucocorticosteroid injections are recommended for the treatment of
subacute or chronic hand osteoarthrosis.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

324

Indications
Moderately severe or severe hand osteoarthrosis pain with insufficient control with
NSAID(s), acetaminophen, and potentially splinting and/or exercise. Its usual purpose is to
gain sufficient relief to either resume medical management or to delay operative
intervention.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
One (1) injection should be scheduled, rather than a series of 3. Various medications have
been used, as well as adjuvant anesthetic agents. There are no head-to-head comparisons in
quality studies of different medications to ascertain optimum medication(s). Various doses
have been utilized without evidence to identify an ideal dose for hand or phalangeal joints.
Indications for discontinuation
A second glucocorticosteroid injection is not recommended if the first has resulted in
significant reduction or resolution of symptoms. If there has not been a response to a first
injection, there is generally less indication for a second. If the physician believes the
medication was not well placed and/or if the underlying condition is so severe that one
steroid bolus could not be expected to adequately treat the condition, a second injection
may be indicated. If placement is thought to be difficult, ultrasound or fluoroscopic
guidance may be particularly indicated for a second injection. In patients who respond with
a pharmacologically appropriate several weeks of temporary partial relief of pain, but who
then have worsening pain and function and who are not (yet) interested in surgical
intervention, a repeat injection is an option. There are not believed to be benefits beyond
approximately 3 injections in a year. Patients requesting a 4th injection should have
reassessment of non-operative management measures and be counseled for possible
surgical intervention.
Rationale
There are several quality studies for treatment of hand osteoarthrosis with
glucocorticosteroids. However, the studies conflict regarding the length of benefits.
However, nearly all studies have suggested benefits (Fuchs et al., 2006, Heyworth et al.,
2008, Stahl et al., 2005, Wollstein et al., 2007). No studies have suggested prolonged
benefits after more than approximately 3 months; thus, these injections are short- to
intermediate-term interventions. Optimal glucocorticoid doses and preferable adjuvant
anesthetic agents are unclear. These injections are invasive, have low adverse effects, and
are moderately costly. They are recommended as an option for treatment of hand OA
patients, particularly after inadequate results from NSAID trials or other non-operative
interventions.

INTRAARTICULAR HYALURONATE INJECTION FOR SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC HAND
OSTEOARTHROSIS
Recommended
Intraarticular hyaluronate injections are recommended for the treatment of subacute or
chronic hand osteoarthrosis.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Hand osteoarthrosis pain with insufficient control with NSAID(s), acetaminophen, and
potentially splinting and/or exercise. Its usual purpose is to gain sufficient relief either to
resume medical management or to delay operative intervention.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Number and frequency of injections are unclear (one trial found no differences between 1,
2, or 3 injections) (Roux et al., 2007). Most physicians perform 3 injections (Fuchs et al.,
2006). See manufacturer’s recommendations.
Indications for discontinuation
Sufficient relief to not require additional injection(s), failure to improve, or allergic
reactions.
Rationale
There are a few quality studies of hyaluronate injections for treatment of hand
osteoarthrosis, which suggest benefits. Duration of improvement is uncertain, although one
trial suggested pain relief as long as 26 weeks (Heyworth et al., 2008). These injections are
invasive, have moderate adverse effects, and are costly. In select cases where other
treatments have failed, these injections are recommended.

PROLOTHERAPY INJECTIONS FOR SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC HAND OSTEOARTHROSIS
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of prolotherapy injections for treatment
of subacute or chronic hand osteoarthrosis.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
Prolotherapy injections are invasive because they require numerous, repeated injections in
phalangeal joints. The magnitude of the purported benefits is modest. The results of the
(Reeves et al., 2000) study suggesting some benefits compared with placebo injections
needs to be replicated, including with a larger sample size, evaluation of functional
outcomes, and a sufficient follow-up duration to allow for an adequate assessment of the
risks and benefits of these procedures prior to a recommendation in favor of this treatment.

SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Various surgical procedures are utilized to treat patients with hand osteoarthrosis (742-755).
Among these are arthrodesis, arthroplasty and various other reconstructive procedures,
although many have been developed and utilized to primarily treat patients with
rheumatoid arthritis (756-758).
RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY FOR SELECT PATIENTS WITH TRAPEZIOMETACARPAL
ARTHROSIS
Recommended
Reconstructive surgery is recommended for treatment of select patients with
trapeziometacarpal arthrosis.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
A presumptive diagnosis of CMC joint arthrosis/basilar (thumb) joint arthrosis requires all of:
●
pain at the base of the thumb with gripping and pinching,
●
tenderness at the base of the thumb joint,
●
pain with compression and/or grind at the base of the thumb joint and
●
symptoms that interfere with activities of daily living and/or work.
A confirmatory diagnosis requires the addition of x-rays with degenerative changes at the
base of the thumb (first CMC/basilar joint/trapeziometacarpal joint).

Nonoperative treatments include:
●
thumb spica splinting,
●
activity modification, and
●
oral analgesics and/or topical NSAIDs.
Surgical considerations include the failure of a minimum of 6 weeks of nonoperative
treatments.

One of the following procedures is indicated based on surgeon's preference and judgment:
●
trapeziectomy,
●
trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI), and
●
fusion of the CMC joint.
Rationale
There are many moderate-quality studies evaluating surgery for hand osteoarthrosis, all of
which concern the basal thumb joint (trapeziometacarpal joint) (Atroshi et al., 1998, Belcher
et al., 2000, Davis et al., 1997, Gibbons et al., 1999, Horlock et al., 2002, Tagil et al., 2002, De

Smet et al., 2002, Vandenbroucke et al., 1997, Young et al., 1998, Davis et al., 2009, Davis et
al., 2004). There are a few quality studies of surgery for rheumatoid arthritic joints, such as
MCP joint replacement . However, these are beyond the scope of this guideline. Most of the
OA studies address a comparison between trapeziectomy and trapeziectomy with ligament
reconstruction or arthroplasty versus tendon interposition arthroplasty. Regardless,
ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition procedures do not appear to be superior
to the simpler trapeziectomy by most measures (Davis et al., 1997, Field et al., 2007, Wajon
et al., 2005, Davis et al., 2009, Davis et al., 2004, Kriegs-Au et al., 2004) (Horlock et al.,
2002). A 17-year follow-up study found similar conclusions regarding a lack of longer-term
superiority of the LRTI procedure . Some studies suggest longer recovery and higher
complication rates with the more extensive procedures, with an average 2-fold greater
complication rate for LRTI. Thus, the ligament reconstruction with tendon interposition
procedure is generally not indicated for most patients. However, there is evidence that grip
strength and tip pinch strength were both superior in the LRTI group compared with simple
trapeziectomy. Accordingly, selective use of the LRTI procedure is recommended for
workers with hand-intensive work, especially that which requires moderate to high hand
forces. Surgery is often career ending for patients who perform manual labor or requires
cessation of manual tasks. Thus, patients should be appropriately counseled as they may
decide that the fulfillment from performing physical labor outweighs the discomfort. There
are no quality studies of joint fusion. However, joint fusion is generally helpful for patients
with significantly symptomatic osteoarthrosis who fail to achieve sufficient relief from other
treatments.

HUMAN AND ANIMAL BITES
OVERVIEW
There are no recently reported rates of human and animal bites in the United States.
However, extrapolation of emergency department visits and other epidemiological studies
from the 1990s indicate there are an estimated 5. 0 million dog bites annually, with roughly
750,000 to 800,000 of those bites of significant severity to require medical treatment (759761)
. Data on cat bites are more limited, but they are the second most common animal bite,
with an estimated 66,000 emergency room visits (762), followed closely by human bites.
Although most bites occur from animals known to the victim, occupations that may be at
higher risk for animal bites include veterinarians (763), animal handlers, police officers, utility
services personnel who access private property, mail carriers, and other similar professions.
Human bites are common in care givers (764,765), educators (766), law enforcement officers
(767)
, and in instances of accident or workplace violence that may involve the fist or hand
being cut by contact with teeth.
A careful history for time and location of the bite and/or contact with saliva should be
obtained as it will help guide clinical decisions regarding prophylaxis. If possible, information
about the type of animal and its health status as well as the circumstances related to why
the bite occurred should be obtained. Tetanus and rabies immunization status should be
established and prophylaxis given if indicated.
The wound should be carefully cleaned and inspected for depth of injury, potential
associated crush injury or fracture, tendon or tendon sheath involvement, foreign body
(e.g., teeth, fur, soil), and joint space involvement.
There are no quality studies on the frequency and timing of follow-up visits for animal or
human bites, or the effectiveness of wound care instruction and education. As the incidence
of infection related to human and cat bites is much higher than for dog bites, there may be a
stronger argument for having these patients present for wound check in 48-72 hours post
injury. Follow-up for non-routine wounds should be dictated by the clinical presentation, or
by other indications such as blood borne pathogens protocols and concurrent injury
management.
Other than deep destruction of tissue requiring reconstruction, risk of infection is the
primary concern for animal bites. There also are other zoonotic diseases such as rabies, cat
scratch fever, and human blood borne pathogens exposures that should also be considered.
The reported incidence of infection from non-complicated bite wounds from dogs is
between 3 and 10% (768,769), from cats is 20 to 50% (759), and from humans is up to 50% (770).
Rates may be higher for wounds of the hand, depth of penetration into the skin, and length
of time before wound is irrigated and cleaned. For purposes of this guideline, discussion and
recommendations are made based on bites and/or contact with saliva regarding rabies risk
to the extremities or trunk as well. Facial injuries are not considered in this guideline and
there may be somewhat different indications as the significance of complications is
generally more severe.

Work activities are expected to be minimally impacted except for limitations related to
treatment of laceration or infection.
Causation is based on the specific major incident that produced the injury.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
ROUTINE WOUND CULTURE AND SENSITIVITY OF ANIMAL AND HUMAN BITES
Not Recommended
Routine culture and sensitivity of animal and human bite wounds is moderately not
recommended as it has not been shown to be an effective predictor for infection or
subsequent treatment of infected wounds.
Strength of evidence Moderately Not Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There is 1 high-quality study and one moderate quality study of primarily animal, but also
included some human bites where uncomplicated bite wounds were routinely cultured prior
to treatment assignment (Boenning et al., 1983, Skurka et al., 1986). In both studies, there
was no correlation between the pathogens that were cultured and any subsequent cultures
from infected wounds (Boenning et al., 1983, Skurka et al., 1986). Another study also
provided culture data, which confirmed expected flora, but no association was drawn in the
analyses with subsequent infections (Brakenbury et al., 1989). These analyses only apply to
wounds that have no joint, tendon, or tendon sheath involvement.
Evidence

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
BLOODBORNE PATHOGEN PROTOCOL FOR HUMAN BITES
Recommended
For human bites, it is recommended that exposures that could be considered high risk for
viral bloodborne pathogen transmission be evaluated and treated according to bloodborne
pathogen protocols.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There is no quality evidence for or against implementing blood borne pathogens protocols
for human bites. However, exposures that could be considered high risk for transmitting
viral blood borne pathogens (HIV, HBV, HCV), such as a traumatic bite lacerations where the
offender may have concurrent oral trauma (fight, accident, seizure) should be considered
for testing and prophylaxis according to standard protocols particularly as needlestick
injuries with HIV contaminated blood carry substantially reduced risk of transmission if
prophylactic anti-virals are administered in a timely manner. Institutions where employees
are at higher risk for human bites may consider implementing policies for this particular
class of injuries. A recent study of police officer bite exposures reported an estimated
exposure rate to possible viral transmission of 68/10,000/year. Of these measured
exposures for this group, 89 (79%) sources were tested, finding 4% HBV-positive, 4% HIVpositive, and 18% HCV-positive (Sonder et al., 2005).

PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS FOR DOG BITE WOUNDS
Recommended
Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for treatment of dog bite wounds.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

Indications
All dog bites. It may be reasonable to omit antibiotics for minor wounds.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Different antibiotics have been used in the quality studies, including penicillin VK, cloxacillin,
dicloxacillin, erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, cephalexin, and amoxicillin/clavulnate. Strong
Gram positive coverage is required. Tailoring the antibiotic selection to anticipated local
antibiotic resistance profiles is advisable.
Rationale
A pooled study of wound infection rates from dog bites was performed for this guideline
that utilized the published data from all high- and moderate-quality studies antibiotics and
showed a 37% reduction in wound infections compared with placebo (Odds Ratio 0. 63, 95%
CI 0. 40, 0. 97). These studies analyzed penicillin (Boenning et al., 1983, Skurka et al., 1986),
penicillinase-resistant penicillins (Dire et al., 1992, Rosen, 1985), sulfa compounds (Jones et
al., 1985), erythromycin (Dire et al., 1992, Rosen, 1985), or amoxicillin/ clavulanate
(Brakenbury et al., 1989). Thus, there is no clear preferential antibiotic to recommend. The
individual studies all failed to show statistically significant reductions in infections, but were
likely underpowered as infections are relatively infrequent and the studies had modest
sample sizes. Prophylactic antibiotics are not invasive, have low adverse effects, and are low
cost (particularly for generic compounds). Thus, they are recommended for treatment of
dog bites.

PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS FOR UNCOMPLICATED HUMAN BITE WOUNDS
Recommended
Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for treatment of uncomplicated human bite
wounds.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

336

Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There is one moderate-quality study of human bites (Zubowicz et al., 1991), and another
moderate-quality study that included human bites along with other animals (Brakenbury et
al., 1989) comparing the utility of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing wound infections.
However, despite a relatively modest sample size in the sole study addressing risk of
infection from human bites, a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic or IV antibiotics was found to
be effective in preventing infection (Zubowicz et al., 1991). The study, which included dogs,
cats, humans, and other animals, did not find any significant differences using Augmentin®
(Brakenbury et al., 1989). Given the reported higher incidence of wound infections related
to human bites and the sole quality study addressing this question documenting success,
the balance of evidence suggests prophylactic treatment is appropriate. Pathogens are
usually gram-positive bacteria; prophylactic coverage from a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic
is suggested to cover most typical staphylococcal and streptococcal species.

PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS FOR UNCOMPLICATED CAT BITE WOUNDS
Recommended
Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for treatment of uncomplicated cat bite wounds.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies of antibiotic prophylaxis for cat bites. Only one study was
found, but was relatively unhelpful due to limited sample size (Elenbaas et al., 1984).
However, the study showed a high incidence of wound infection in the placebo group (4 of
6) compared to none in the oxacillin prophylaxis group. Reported incidence rates of
infections from cat bites is 20 to 40% (Patrick et al., 1998), and complications related to cat
bites may be more significant. Therefore, broad spectrum antibiotics that include coverage

(Talan et al., 1999), may be indicated.

LACERATION REPAIR FOR DOG-BITE WOUNDS
Recommended
Suturing of non-complicated dog bite wounds after adequate wound care is recommended
as it may lead to a better cosmetic result and is not likely to result in increased wound
infections over wounds allowed to heal by secondary intent.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There is one moderate-quality study of laceration repair for dog bite wounds (Dire et al.,
1992). There are no quality studies for human or cat bite lacerations. A low-quality study
compared infection rates and cosmetic outcomes of dog bite wounds repaired with
monofilament suture versus allowing to heal by secondary intent (Maimaris et al., 1988).
There was no difference found in infection rates. Patients were less satisfied with the
cosmetic outcome in the non-sutured group. No statistically significant difference was found
in infection rates in sutured wounds (Dire et al., 1992). These and several other studies
considered in the antibiotic prophylaxis recommendation section have concluded that
wound care (irrigation, debridement, cleansing) is the primary factor for preventing
infection.

ANTIEMETICS
See the ACOEM Antiemetics Guideline.

KIENBÖCK DISEASE
OVERVIEW
Kienböck disease involves changes in the lunate that eventually lead to collapse of the
lunate bone, which results in progressive pain and disability. It is a controversial condition
from the standpoint of work-relatedness, as it is a disease and there are no quality studies
on cause.
The patient typically presents with progressive pain and disability and has characteristic
wrist x-rays demonstrating changes in the lunate. The patient may complain of increasing
wrist pain, pain with movement, pain with use, and limited range of motion.
The physical examination may be normal early, but generally the patient has mild to
moderate dorsal wrist tenderness while also having asymmetric, limited range of motion.
Tenderness and limited range of motion tend to progress.
Patients with Kienbock disease generally require periodic appointments to follow the clinical
course. Frequencies of appointments may be greater where workplace limitations are
required. Post-operative rehabilitation can be considerable, with a requirement for
occupational or physical therapy on a prolonged basis in order for the patient to recover as
much function as possible.
There is no evidence that work restrictions are helpful, yet as the condition often
progresses, patients typically incur increasing degrees of disability with a progressive need
for work limitations. Advanced cases generally require temporary removal from work and
surgery, with return to work post-operatively. Post-operative limitations are generally based
on a combination of the clinical results (i.e., severity of pain and symptoms) and work
demands. Patients with light to medium work may require no limitations, while those with
medium to heavy work, particularly with post-operative pain may require significant
limitations.
This disorder is a disease without sound epidemiological support for work-relatedness. It
may be reasonable to hypothesize work-relatedness in those cases where the onset is
promptly after a discrete, significant traumatic event. However, in most cases, a physical
cause is speculative.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Diagnosis is based on the presentation of non-radiating wrist compartment pain, limited
range of motion, and x-ray evidence of radiological collapse of the lunate.
X-RAYS TO DIAGNOSE KIENBOCK DISEASE
Recommended
X-rays are recommended to diagnose Kienbock disease.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating the use of x-rays to diagnose Kienbock disease.
However, x-rays are used to confirm the diagnosis and are moderately costly, thus they are
recommended. X-rays generally should be taken of both hands.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: Kienbock’s
disease, X-ray, radiography, radiograph; controlled clinical trial, controlled trials,
randomized controlled trial, randomized controlled trials, random allocation, random*,

prospective studies. We found, reviewed and considered for inclusion 3 articles in PubMed,
347 in Scopus, 2 in CINAHL, 12 in Cochrane Library, 140 in Google Scholar and zero in other
sources. Zero articles met the inclusion criteria.
CT TO DIAGNOSE KIENBOCK DISEASE
Recommended
CT is recommended to diagnose Kienbock disease when x-rays are negative or unclear.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There is one quality study evaluating the use of CT scans that included patients with
Kienböck disease, suggesting that 3-D CT may provide more information than x-ray or plain
CT (Nakamura et al., 1990). CT is used to assist with diagnosis and management; thus, it is
recommended where x-rays are negative or unclear.

MRI TO DIAGNOSE KIENBOCK DISEASE
Recommended
MRI is recommended to diagnose Kienbock disease.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are 2 moderate-quality articles evaluating the use of MRI to diagnose Kienböck
disease. However, MRI was not shown to have superior performance for diagnostic
purposes. MRI is used to assist with diagnosis and management; thus, it is recommended.
There are 2 moderate-quality studies incorporated into this analysis (Hashizume et al., 1996,

SCREENING FOR SYSTEMIC DISORDERS FOR KIENBOCK DISEASE
Recommended
Screening for systemic disorders is recommended for patients with Kienbock disease.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

341

Rationale
There are multiple disorders that are thought to predispose to Kienbock disease. These
disorders may be otherwise asymptomatic, there may be potential to develop other
manifestations of these diseases including in the other hand, and it may be possible to slow
the rate of progression of this condition through active clinical management. Thus, the
threshold for evaluations of systemic metabolic issues (e.g., diabetes, glucose intolerance),
alcoholism, and rheumatological studies should be low, particularly as potentially modifiable
risks may theoretically slow the rate of progression or prevent the disease in the other
hand.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
Over-the-counter medications are generally helpful for pain associated with Kienbock
disease. Prescription medications may be needed for moderate to severe cases. Patients
with Kienbock disease often develop chronic pain (see Chronic Pain Guideline for a
comprehensive approach to managing chronic pain). An abbreviated approach is noted
below. Exercise is generally not utilized during acute presentations of Kienbock disease.
However, exercise is nearly always necessary for post-operative patients and is frequently
used for patients in the subacute and chronic phases.
SELF-APPLICATION OF ICE FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC KIENBOCK DISEASE
Recommended
Self-application of ice is recommended for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic
Kienbock disease.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating the use of ice or heat for treatment of Kienbock
disease. However, these treatments may help with symptomatic relief. These interventions
are not invasive, have no adverse effects, and are not costly, thus they are recommended.

There are no quality studies evaluating splinting for Kienbock disease. A trial may be helpful
to assess whether splinting provides symptomatic relief. Splints are not invasive and have
few adverse effects over the short term although over the long term there are concerns
regarding the potential for accelerated debility disuse and weakness of the wrist. Splints are
also low cost. Thus, they are recommended for select patients.

Frequency/Dose/Duration
In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operative, appointments should be scheduled
generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there has been functional improvements yet there
are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is often
helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week appointments)
may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe, and there is
ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g., increased
grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities, increased
duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are appropriate when
there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent objective functional
gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the therapy.

Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating surgical repair for Kienböck disease. There are many
different surgical procedures and no quality comparative studies that have been reported.
Surgical procedures utilized have included: lunate excision with silicone implants (Kato et al.,
1986, Lichtman et al., 1982, Lichtman et al., 1977) (no longer recommended), excision with
autogenous soft tissue implants including coiled palmaris longus tendon (Kato et al., 1986,
Horita et al., 1990, Minami et al., 1994, Rhee et al., 1996, Sakai et al., 2004, Ueba et al.,
1999, Yajima et al., 1998), external fixation (Ueba et al., 1999, Zelouf et al., 1996),
arthrodesis (Meier et al., 2004, Watson et al., 1985), radial shortening (Nakamura et al.,
1990, Takahara et al., 2009), scaphoid-trapezium-trapezoid fusion (Yajima et al., 1998,
Soejima et al., 2002, Watson et al., 2003), in advanced cases, proximal row carpectomy
(Begley et al., 1994, Culp et al., 1993, Diao et al., 2005), lunate core decompression
(Mehrpour et al., 2011, Rodrigues-Pinto et al., 2012), and vascularized bone transfers (Lu et
al., 2006). A comparative clinical trial found superior clinical results and better preservation
of carpal height ratio using palmaris longus tendon ball with a bone core compared with no
bone core (Sakai et al., 2004). In the absence of quality studies, the main determinant of
surgical technique is the experience and comfort of the surgeon with specific treatment
approaches.

LACERATIONS
OVERVIEW
Traumatic injuries resulting in skin lacerations of the upper extremity are a common reason
for patient visits to an urgent care, occupational medicine clinic or emergency department.
Lacerations result from blunt or crush injuries that produce shear forces, or more commonly
from sharp objects which are abundant in the workplace (771). The majority of lacerations
can be treated on an outpatient basis. The primary purpose of wound and laceration
management is to avoid infection, detect if a nerve injury has occurred, manage tendon
lacerations, and achieve a cosmetically acceptable result with the highest degree of function
(772)
and patient satisfaction (773). The most optimal results are accomplished by preventing
infection through thorough wound cleansing, approximating wound edges with appropriate
closure techniques, and providing a proper dressing with a clean moist environment to
accelerate wound healing (774-776).
A thorough history of the injury, with particular attention to mechanism, potential degree of
wound contamination, potential for foreign bodies, and presence of other trauma should be
obtained. Crush wounds may be more susceptible to infection, and contamination.
Additionally, inquiry of personal factors that may contribute to delayed healing or increased
risk for infection, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, or the use of
immunosuppressive medications should be included (777). Tetanus immunization status
should be noted and are recommended to be updated per CDC guidelines (see Table 4).
Close inspection of the wound should be performed under proper lighting. Control of
bleeding may be required, generally by applying appropriate pressure and elevation to the
wound. The wound should be evaluated for damage to underlying structures including joint
involvement, vessels, tendons, bone and nerves. Sensory examination should be
accomplished prior to anesthetic administration. Examination of involved muscles should be
conducted if nerve injury is suspected. Close inspection should be made for foreign bodies.
There are no quality studies on return to work and restrictions for upper extremity
laceration repair. Movement of injured body parts is thought to promote earlier recovery
and minimize disability. Most patients should be able to return to work with appropriate
task specific restrictions while the wound is healing. Accommodation for prescribed
medications, elevation, splinting and modalities such as use of heat or ice may be necessary.
While there is no quality evidence for any of these modalities, keeping the wound dry for
the first few days, splinting, elevation, and heat or ice are simple techniques that are
believed to be helpful. Splinting is generally limited to extensor surface lacerations that
cross a joint and involve sufficient tension to pull wound edges apart (778).
Causation is based on the specific major incident that produced the injury.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
There are no quality studies on diagnostic testing for the evaluation of wounds with
lacerations. However, among the minority of wounds of sufficient severity, the use of
imaging to rule out traumatic injury to bone or other structures is generally considered
effective and well established. Yet, detection of retained soft tissue foreign bodies remains a
clinical dilemma, with one study reporting up to 38% of foreign bodies in hand wounds
going undetected by the initial clinician, resulting in the second-leading cause of lawsuits in
emergency medicine (779). Furthermore, if nerve injury is detected or suspected, then EDS
may be indicated 2 to 3 weeks post-injury. An immediate EDS is not recommended as
Walerian degeneration will not have been completed until at least 2 weeks post-injury,
making earlier studies falsely normal.
X-RAYS FOR EVALUATION OF LACERATIONS WITH SUSPECTED FRACTURE OR FOREIGN
BODY
Recommended
X-rays are recommended for the evaluation of traumatic injury resulting in skin lacerations
to rule out fracture or if a radiopaque foreign body is suspected.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
Most work-related lacerations presenting to clinics are too superficial to involve the bone or
joints. However, if the injury mechanism or location of injury suggests a possibility of
fracture, x-rays are indicated (see specific fracture sections for further recommendations).

There are no quality studies of imaging techniques for the evaluation of suspected foreign
bodies. If a foreign body is suspected, additional diagnostic testing should be considered
dependent on the suspected foreign body type. For suspected radiopaque substances such
as metals or glass, traditional x-ray reliably detects the foreign body 80 to 95% of the time
(Blankenship et al., 2007). However, x-ray images do not reliably detect radiolucent foreign
bodies such as wood, plastic, or vegetative material.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: Laceration
management, x-ray, xray, radiography, lacerations with suspected fracture, foreign bodies,
diagnostic, diagnosis, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive
value, and predictive value of tests, efficacy, and efficiency. We found and reviewed 24
articles in PubMed, 20 in Scopus, 0 in CINAHL, 0 in Cochrane Library, and 1880 from Google
Scholar. We considered for inclusion 0 from PubMed, 0 from Scopus, 0 from CINAHL, 0 from
Cochrane Library, 0 from Google Scholar, and 0 from other sources. Zero articles met the
inclusion criteria.
ULTRASOUND FOR EVALUATION OF SUSPECTED SUPERFICIAL FOREIGN BODIES
Recommended
Ultrasound is recommended for evaluating suspected radiolucent materials or as an
alternative test when radiopaque foreign body is suspected but not detected on x-ray
images.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
Ultrasound is increasingly being utilized for the evaluation of suspected radiolucent foreign
bodies (Blankenship et al., 2007), although there are no quality studies available. There are
several case series and cadaver studies (Banerjee et al., 1991, Crawford et al., 1989, Gilbert
et al., 1990, Hill et al., 1997, Levine et al., 1993) providing reports of high sensitivity,
although there are also a small number of false positives related to tendons or other
artifacts.

considered for inclusion 45 diagnostic studies met the inclusion criteria.
CT FOR EVALUATION OF SUSPECTED SUPERFICIAL FOREIGN BODIES
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of CT for suspected superficial foreign
bodies. CT is not routinely recommended, but may be indicated for the evaluation of
suspected radiolucent materials and as an alternative test when radiopaque foreign body is
suspected but is not detected on x-ray images or ultrasound.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
CT has reported high sensitivity for radiopaque substances, and moderate sensitivity for
radiolucent materials. Because of increased costs, higher radiation exposure, with
intermediate sensitivity, CT may be best used when a foreign body is suspected but not
detected by x-rays or ultrasound. MRI is not indicated for evaluation of metallic foreign
bodies in particular.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
INITIAL CARE
Optimal results are accomplished by preventing infection through thorough wound
cleansing, approximating wound edges with appropriate closure techniques, and providing a
clean, moist environment to accelerate wound healing. If nerve injury is detected or
suspected then appropriate surgical consultation should be considered. Wound anesthesia
is commonly obtained after completing a sensory examination through local infiltration,
digital nerve block or topical application of anesthetic preparations. Anesthetic technique is
most commonly performed based on wound location and the preference of the treating
health care professional. Wound repair is most commonly performed through primary
closure (immediate approximation of the wound edges) to reduce discomfort and speed
healing. Closure of most low-risk wounds can occur 12 to 24 hours after the injury.
Contaminated wounds or those at high risk of infection should be closed within 6 hours (775).
Wounds outside of these parameters can be treated by delayed primary intention after 2-3
days of antibiotics reducing risk for subsequent infection. Sutures are the most common
method, followed by staples, adhesives, and tapes.

WOUND CLEANSING, IRRIGATION, AND DEBRIDEMENT
Recommended
Meticulous wound preparation after appropriate anesthesia using saline irrigation or
copious amounts of running tap water, scrubbing, and debridement of devitalized tissue is
recommended.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Rationale
Wounds become infected when they contain more than 105 bacteria per gram of tissue
(Moscati et al., 2007). As there is no test to determine the immediate bacterial load of a
particular laceration, it seems prudent that all wounds should undergo some form of
cleansing to decrease the amount of soil or presence of small foreign bodies to reduce the
inoculation of bacteria and prevent infection. There are no quality studies comparing
infection rates in wounds that are irrigated vs. non-irrigated or cleansed. However, it is
widely accepted that irrigation and cleansing are best practice. Therefore, although there is
a lack of quality evidence, wound cleansing, irrigation, and debridement are recommended.
Optimal irrigating solutions and techniques are more controversial.
There is moderate evidence that irrigation solution does not make a significant difference in
infection rates of routine laceration management. A high-quality study comparing tap water
to sterile saline in a pediatric population showed no difference in infection rates at 48 hours
(Bansal et al., 2002). Another moderate-quality study of 715 lacerations randomized to
irrigation under regular tap water vs. sterile saline using pressure syringe irrigation also
found no significant difference in infection rates (Moscati et al., 2007). Patients enrolled in
tap water irrigation were instructed to wash their wound under regular tap water (U. S.
location) for a minimum of 2 minutes. However, the power of these studies to detect
differences in infection rates may be too low to conclude inferiority. On balance, there
appears to be no difference in infection rates between the common practice of using sterile
saline for routine laceration repair or using regular tap water for uncomplicated extremity
lacerations and either wound irrigation with sterile saline or tap water is recommended.
There is no quality evidence supporting the use of concentrated povidine-iodine solution
instillation into the wound, although a low-quality study suggests some benefit in reduced
infection rates (Gravett et al., 1987), another low-quality study found no difference in
infection rates between normal saline, povidine, and Shur Clens® (Dire et al., 1990). There is
some concern that concentrated povidine-iodine, hydrogen peroxide, and detergents may
cause tissue toxicity (Singer et al., 1997).
There are no quality studies on irrigation pressures. High-pressure irrigation may result in
increased trauma (Singer et al., 1997). Optimal pressures of 5 to 8 psi generated by large
syringe and 16- to 19-gauge needle have been recommended (Singer et al., 1997). One
moderate-quality study compared a commercial pressurized canister irrigation system with
a standard syringe and 20-gauge catheter at maximal plunger force using saline and
benzalkonium chloride (Chisholm et al., 1992). The study had weaknesses but found no

353

difference in infection rates or soft tissue trauma between the groups. The only advantage
was that irrigation times were shorter (3. 9 versus 7. 3 minutes) using the canister.
For lacerations that involve skin areas where significant hair may hamper closure efforts,
removal by clipping rather than shaving is commonly suggested to reduce potential sources
of contamination resultant from disturbing bacteria on hair shafts, although there is no
evidence to support this method in routine laceration repair. Debridement of devitalized
tissue through surgical excision and scrubbing may also reduce the risk of infection.
Generally, sterile technique has been recommended. However, there is one large moderatequality study of 816 lacerations that showed no difference in infection rates in repair using
sterile gloves versus non-sterile clean gloves (Perelman et al., 2004), thus either is
recommended.

LOCAL INFILTRATION PLUS TOPICAL ANESTHETIC OR DIGITAL BLOCK FOR FINGER
LACERATION REPAIR
Recommended
Adequate anesthesia by either topical anesthetic plus local infiltration or digital block is
moderately recommended for finger laceration repair. There is no recommendation of one
technique over the other. For distal finger lacerations, digital block may be substantially less
painful than local infiltration performed without topical anesthetic. If the operator and
patient preference is digital block, the various techniques are described and evaluated in the
management of phalangeal fracture section in this guideline.
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are numerous quality studies of different anesthetic techniques for management of
laceration repairs of the finger. There is one high-quality and one moderate-quality study
comparing local infiltration to digital block for finger lacerations. However, in the highquality study, both received topical anesthesia which may have otherwise confounded the
results. The authors found no difference in pain of providing anesthesia or quality of
anesthesia between the two techniques (Chale et al., 2006). Digital anesthesia was
preferred by clinicians and patients for both the application and quality of anesthesia in a
moderate quality study (Robson et al., 1990), although it was uncertain if the comparison
groups had similar baseline pain. Although there may be a modest advantage to digital
anesthesia, there is not enough evidence to support one technique over the other, and both
are recommended based on operator and patient preference.

There is one quality study that compared topical anesthetics with placebo (Pryor et al.,
1980), and that trial demonstrated efficacy, although it is a remote study utilizing
Tetracaine-Adrenaline-Cocaine (TAC) and topical lidocaine. However, there are many trials
comparing different topical agents. Topical anesthetics are applied to provide analgesia for
subsequent local infiltration, or to provide anesthesia for wound repair. Topical anesthetics
used for laceration repair without local infiltration are best used in highly vascularized
regions, although they have also been used successfully in the extremity. In the past, TAC
has been used effectively (Pryor et al., 1980, Kuhn et al., 1996, Vinci et al., 1996), but
concerns of toxicity have resulted in the development and use of non-cocaine containing
products. Lidocaine-Adrenaline-Tetracaine (LAT, LET) and EMLA are now the primary topical
anesthetics used in the United States. LAT has been shown to be more effective than TAC in
one high-quality study (Ernst et al., 1995) for topical anesthesia and as effective in another
high-quality study (Schilling et al., 1995) for topical pre-treatment for infiltration. EMLA was
also shown to be more effective for topical anesthesia than TAC in a moderate quality study
(Zempsky et al., 1997). There is one high-quality study comparing EMLA and LAT for topical
anesthesia that demonstrated equal efficacy, with a slight advantage to LET in the time to
achieving anesthesia (Singer et al., 2001). Thus, there is sufficient evidence to support the
use of LAT and EMLA for pretreatment and for primary anesthesia in select wounds in adult
populations.
Although local infiltration is the most common technique, there are no quality studies of
local anesthetic infiltration versus placebo. Nor are there any quality studies comparing
topical anesthetics to local infiltration or nerve blocks. As local infiltration is the gold
standard for most wound repair, and the failure of topical anesthetics is treated by local
infiltration or nerve block in complicated wounds, there is no recommendation for the use
of topical anesthetics over local infiltration.
There is one high-quality study comparing lidocaine solutions with buffering, the addition of
epinephrine, and the use of diphenhydramine as an alternative (Ernst et al., 1995) for upper
extremity wounds. Lidocaine with epinephrine with or without buffering was preferred by
patients over diphenhydramine or buffered solutions without epinephrine. This result
contradicts with common anecdote of using buffered solutions to reduce injection pain.

LOCAL INFILTRATION FOR EXTREMITY WOUND REPAIR
Recommended
Instillation of local anesthetic for extremity wounds after sensory testing is recommended
as the first-line technique for most laceration repairs unless the size or complexity would
require potentially toxic doses of local anesthetic. Local anesthetic with epinephrine (except
digits) is recommended.

studies of local anesthetic infiltration versus placebo. Nor are there any quality studies
comparing topical anesthetics to local infiltration or nerve blocks. As local infiltration is the
gold standard for most wound repair, and the failure of topical anesthetics is treated by
local infiltration or nerve block in complicated wounds, there is no recommendation for the

lidocaine solutions with buffering, the addition of epinephrine, and the use of
diphenhydramine as an alternative (Ernst et al., 1995) for upper extremity wounds.
Lidocaine with epinephrine with or without buffering was preferred by patients over
diphenhydramine or buffered solutions without epinephrine. This result contradicts with
common anecdote of using buffered solutions to reduce injection pain.

TOPICAL ANESTHETICS FOR LACERATIONS
Recommended
The use of topical anesthetics, Tetracaine-Adrenaline-Cocaine (TAC) and EMLA, are
recommended as an alternative to local infiltration for lacerations of the extremities
(excluding digits) or as pre-treatment to reduce pain related to needle infiltration. However,
these anesthetics have longer times to onset of effective anesthesia.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are numerous quality studies of different anesthetic techniques for management of
laceration repairs of the finger. There is one high-quality and one moderate-quality study
comparing local infiltration to digital block for finger lacerations. However, in the highquality study, both received topical anesthesia which may have otherwise confounded the
results. The authors found no difference in pain of providing anesthesia or quality of
anesthesia between the two techniques (Chale et al., 2006). Digital anesthesia was
preferred by clinicians and patients for both the application and quality of anesthesia in a
moderate quality study (Robson et al., 1990), although it was uncertain if the comparison
groups had similar baseline pain. Although there may be a modest advantage to digital
anesthesia, there is not enough evidence to support one technique over the other, and both
are recommended based on operator and patient preference. There is one quality study
that compared topical anesthetics with placebo (Pryor et al., 1980), and that trial
demonstrated efficacy, although it is a remote study utilizing Tetracaine-Adrenaline-Cocaine

(TAC) and topical lidocaine. However, there are many trials comparing different topical
agents. Topical anesthetics are applied to provide analgesia for subsequent local infiltration,
or to provide anesthesia for wound repair. Topical anesthetics used for laceration repair
without local infiltration are best used in highly vascularized regions, although they have
also been used successfully in the extremity. In the past, TAC has been used effectively
(Pryor et al., 1980, Kuhn et al., 1996, Vinci et al., 1996), but concerns of toxicity have
resulted in the development and use of non-cocaine containing products. LidocaineAdrenaline-Tetracaine (LAT, LET) and EMLA are now the primary topical anesthetics used in
the United States. LAT has been shown to be more effective than TAC in one high-quality
study (Ernst et al., 1995) for topical anesthesia and as effective in another high-quality study
(Schilling et al., 1995) for topical pre-treatment for infiltration. EMLA was also shown to be
more effective for topical anesthesia than TAC in a moderate quality study (Zempsky et al.,
1997). There is one high-quality study comparing EMLA and LAT for topical anesthesia that
demonstrated equal efficacy, with a slight advantage to LET in the time to achieving
anesthesia (Singer et al., 2001). Thus, there is sufficient evidence to support the use of LAT
and EMLA for pretreatment and for primary anesthesia in select wounds in adult
populations. Although local infiltration is the most common technique, there are no quality
studies of local anesthetic infiltration versus placebo. Nor are there any quality studies
comparing topical anesthetics to local infiltration or nerve blocks. As local infiltration is the
gold standard for most wound repair, and the failure of topical anesthetics is treated by
local infiltration or nerve block in complicated wounds, there is no recommendation for the
use of topical anesthetics over local infiltration. There is one high-quality study comparing
lidocaine solutions with buffering, the addition of epinephrine, and the use of
diphenhydramine as an alternative (Ernst et al., 1995) for upper extremity wounds.
Lidocaine with epinephrine with or without buffering was preferred by patients over
diphenhydramine or buffered solutions without epinephrine. This result contradicts with
common anecdote of using buffered solutions to reduce injection pain.

EXERCISE FOR PATIENTS WITH LACERATIONS
Sometimes Recommended
Exercise is not indicated acutely. For a few patients with major trauma, or complex wounds,
exercise in the recovery period is necessary. For patients with residual deficits, particularly
post-operatively, see the recommendations for carpal tunnel syndrome.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operative, appointments should be scheduled
generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there has been functional improvements yet there
are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is often
helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week appointments)
may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe, and there is
ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g., increased
grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities, increased
duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are appropriate when
there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent objective functional
gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the therapy.

There are no quality studies incorporated into this analysis.

ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS IN UNCOMPLICATED HAND AND FOREARM LACERATIONS
Not Recommended
Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for uncomplicated hand and forearm
lacerations.

Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are two moderate-quality studies conducted over 25 years ago that demonstrated no
difference in infection rates between no treatment or placebo and prophylactic oral doses
of clindamycin, flucloxacillin, trilopen, and aerosolized povidine – iodine applied directly into
the wound (Roberts et al., 1977, Roberts et al., 1985). However, one moderate-quality study
did find that wound irrigation with penicillin provided reduced rates of wound infection
(Lindsey et al., 1982). Each of these studies had significant weaknesses, and strong
conclusions cannot be drawn. Two low-quality studies of cephalexin and clindamycin
demonstrated no improvement in infection rates but are excluded from the analysis
because of lack of study details (Morgan et al., 1980, Thirlby et al., 1983). There are no
quality data or recent data on newer broad-spectrum antibiotics for prophylaxis. Adequate
irrigation, cleansing, and debridement of non-complicated wounds is therefore
recommended as first line treatment to prevent infection, whereas antibiotic prophylaxis is
not recommended unless other complicating factors warrant.
The use of topical antimicrobials is also common, but it is controversial. A high-quality study
(Dire et al., 1995) demonstrated a lower infection rate in wounds treated with topical
antibiotics vs. petroleum ointment, although the control group’s treatment may preclude
strong conclusions. Although there was lower incidence of infection in the active
antimicrobial arms vs. petrolatum, the infection rates were similar to other reported
incidences that did not use any ointment. It is not possible to determine if the use of
antimicrobial is efficacious, or if the use of non-antimicrobial ointment may increase
infection risk. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of
topical antimicrobials, although they are generally inexpensive, easy to apply, and have
relatively low risks for adverse effects. Wounds closed with tissue adhesives should remain
uncovered, and application of ointments or antimicrobials should be avoided to reduce risk
of dehiscence (Patel et al., 2007). An additional concern is that neomycin is considerably
allergenic, thus neomycin-containing compounds may have a relative disadvantage.

SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
NON-SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF NON-COMPLICATED HAND LACERATIONS LESS THAN
2CM IN LINEAR LENGTH
Recommended
It is recommended that non-complicated linear lacerations of the hand less than 2cm be
managed without suturing by healing via secondary intention for some workers. Wounds
should be carefully selected, not have tension, including not overlying or near joints and not
have tension applied due to manual labor.

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

366

Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There is one moderate-quality study comparing suture repair with non-surgical treatment
(secondary intention) for hand lacerations less than 2 cm in length and uncomplicated by
underlying joint, tendon, fracture, or nerve injury or medical conditions that would affect
healing (Quinn et al., 2002). There were no differences between the groups in cosmetic
appearance, return to activity, or infection. As many hand lacerations are small and
uncomplicated, this study suggests non-surgical management for non-gaping uncomplicated
lacerations of the hand may be appropriate. Although, a comprehensive recommendation
for working populations is not made as the clinician should consider tensile forces on the
wound and other environmental exposures resultant from occupational duties that likely
reduce the ability to use non-surgical management for some patients in making a treatment
decision.
There are no quality RCTs of upper extremity wound lacerations comparing suture repair
with healing by secondary intent for gaping lacerations exceeding 2cm in linear length.
However, wound closure most commonly by suture techniques has been long performed
making suture repair the basis for other comparison studies. Therefore, although there is a
lack of supporting studies, suturing is considered first line for laceration repair, with the
strength of other repair recommendations made against using secondary intent in noninfected wounds.
Various suture techniques have been described to provide the approximation of skin
margins. However, there is a relative lack of quality studies that are methodologically sound
while also having sufficient follow-up time of greater than one year to derive robust
conclusions regarding the relative merit of different suturing techniques. Optimal results are
thought to be dependent on skin edge eversion to eliminate depressed scarring, elimination
of dead space and minimization of tension of individual sutures to avoid tissue necrosis.
Common techniques include simple interrupted, vertical mattress, and running sutures.
There are two moderate-quality studies of suture techniques, although there were no direct
comparisons between the common techniques. Two versions of vertical mattress were
compared with no difference in outcomes in a low quality study (Jones et al., 1993). Simple
running cutaneous suture was compared with running subcutaneous sutures (removed at
14 days and not removed non-absorbable suture) and subcutaneous polygalactin
(absorbable) running suture for treatment of post-elliptical excisions, rather than traumatic
lacerations (Alam et al., 2006). There were short and intermediate advantages of
polygalactin vs. polypropylene subcutaneous sutures, which disappeared at 9 months. This
study, however, may not be generalizable to laceration repairs. Comparison of single layer
vs. bi-layer repair for minor lacerations showed no difference in cosmetic results, although
this was a study of facial lacerations, and may not be applicable even though the face is
considered cosmetically more sensitive than the extremity (Singer et al., 2005). Therefore,
there is no quality evidence to recommend one technique over another, and there are
multiple scenarios that one technique might offer technical advantage over another, so that
the operator focus may best be on principles for assuring optimal results.

There is also a lack of quality data comparing suture types for extremity laceration repair.
The available cosmetic studies are both methodologically weak and have inadequate followup times to derive clinically meaningful differences on cosmesis (Durani et al., 2009). One
moderate-quality study showed comparability of absorbable catgut to nylon sutures for
simple repair (Karounis et al., 2004). A low-quality study showed no difference between
absorbable suture with nylon suture (Mouzas et al., 1975). A systematic review in pediatric
and adult populations of absorbable vs. non-absorbable sutures did not find superiority of
one over the other (Al-Abdullah et al., 2007). Another moderate-quality study compared
Teno Fix® repair, which uses a multifilament stainless steel suture, to a simple repair with
cruciate suture for flexor tendon lacerations and found that repairs with the Teno Fix® had
lower rupture rates and similar functional outcomes when compared with conventional
repair (Su et al., 2005). Thus, there is insufficient quality evidence to make a
recommendation for or against the use of absorbable or non-absorbable suture material for
superficial closure of extremity lacerations.
In addition to evaluating different types of sutures, one moderate-quality study compared
suturing to stapling and concluded that stapling is more cost-effective than sutures.
However, no outcomes measures for cosmetic results or complications were presented
(Orlinsky et al., 1995).
There are 17 moderate-quality studies comparing tissue adhesives with standard suture
repair of routine extremity lacerations that have shown at least equivalent or superior
cosmetic results with no statistically significant increase in infections, dehiscence rates, or
other complications (Limpaphayom et al., 2004, Barnett et al., 1998, Bruns et al., 1998,
Bruns et al., 1996, Handschel et al., 2006, Holger et al., 2004, Hollander et al., 1998, Quinn
et al., 1997, Quinn et al., 2002, Shamiyeh et al., 2001, Simon et al., 1997, Simon et al., 1998,
Singer et al., 2002, Singer et al., 2002, Sinha et al., 2001, Toriumi et al., 1998, Goktas et al.,
2002, Mattick et al., 2002, Zempsky et al., 2001). Advantages to using tissue adhesives also
include elimination of the need for local anesthesia, significant reduction of repair time, and
ease of performing the procedure saving on visit time over suture repair. Disadvantages of
wound characteristics (especially depth and length) and occupational tasks requiring
considerable tension are considerable in working populations and are discussed below.
The most commonly used tissue adhesive is octylcyanoacrylate also known as Dermabond®.
The other major glue is N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate, also known as Histoacryl® and Histoacryl
Blue®, which has a blue tint for reported easier application (Quinn et al., 1993). The only
two direct comparisons of the compounds, which showed no difference in outcomes
measures (Osmond et al., 1999, Singer et al., 2003).
In each of the studies which included traumatic and surgical wounds of the hands, upper
extremities, trunk and face in both pediatric (1-18 years of age) and adult populations,
wound characteristics were usually limited to non-crush injuries, less than 4 cm in length,
less than 5mm deep, and without other complicating factors including history of keloid or
other scarring disorders, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid or other immunosuppressant use,
or debilitating illnesses. Thus, the results of equivalency in treatment may not be applicable
to many with work-related upper extremity lacerations.

Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

368

Tissue adhesive was also compared to the use of Steri-Strips in 7 moderate-quality studies
as either a primary comparison (Mattick et al., 2002, Zempsky et al., 1997) or as part of the
“standard care” treatment arm (Bruns et al., 1998, Hollander et al., 1998, Shamiyeh et al.,
2001, Singer et al., 2002, Singer et al., 2002). In each trial, Steri-Strips were found to be
equivalent in efficacy to tissue adhesive with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Tissue adhesive was also compared with the use of skin stapling in 5 moderate quality
studies (Singer et al., 1998, Bruns et al., 1996, Hollander et al., 1998, Singer et al., 2002,
Singer et al., 2002) as part of the non-surgical treatment arms. In each of these studies, the
results were equivalent in all outcomes measures.
Therefore, there is strong evidence that tissue adhesives, skin stapling, and adhesive tapes
are effective in the repair of routine lacerations of the upper extremity provided they are
used on skin areas that are not subject to significant tension (i.e., joints, creases in hand,
etc.). In appropriate cases, these have the added advantage of reduced operator or
procedural time and material costs compared with suture repair.

However, no outcomes measures for cosmetic results or complications were presented

tissue adhesive is octylcyanoacrylate also known as Dermabond®. The other major glue is Nbutyl 2-cyanoacrylate, also known as Histoacryl® and Histoacryl Blue®, which has a blue tint
for reported easier application (Quinn et al., 1993). The only two direct comparisons of the
compounds, which showed no difference in outcomes measures (Osmond et al., 1999). In
each of the studies which included traumatic and surgical wounds of the hands, upper
extremities, trunk and face in both pediatric (1-18 years of age) and adult populations,
wound characteristics were usually limited to non-crush injuries, less than 4 cm in length,
less than 5mm deep, and without other complicating factors including history of keloid or
other scarring disorders, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid or other immunosuppressant use,
or debilitating illnesses. Thus, the results of equivalency in treatment may not be applicable
to many with work-related upper extremity lacerations. Tissue adhesive was also compared
to the use of Steri-Strips in 7 moderate-quality studies as either a primary comparison
(Mattick et al., 2002, Zempsky et al., 1997) or as part of the “standard care” treatment arm
(Bruns et al., 1998, Shamiyeh et al., 2001, Singer et al., 2002, Singer et al., 2002). In each
trial, Steri-Strips were found to be equivalent in efficacy to tissue adhesive with the same
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Tissue adhesive was also compared with the use of skin
stapling in 5 moderate quality studies (Singer et al., 1998, Bruns et al., 1996, Singer et al.,
2002, Singer et al., 2002) as part of the non-surgical treatment arms. In each of these
studies, the results were equivalent in all outcomes measures. Therefore, there is strong
evidence that tissue adhesives, skin stapling, and adhesive tapes are effective in the repair
of routine lacerations of the upper extremity provided they are used on skin areas that are
not subject to significant tension (i.e., joints, creases in hand, etc.). In appropriate cases,
these have the added advantage of reduced operator or procedural time and material costs
compared with suture repair.

SUTURE REPAIR FOR HAND OR FOREARM LACERATIONS
Recommended
Suture repair is moderately recommended for lacerations of the hand or forearm as these
lacerations respond well to common suture techniques and suture materials. There are no
recommendations for one technique over another or for one suture material type over
another.
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There is one moderate-quality study comparing suture repair with non-surgical treatment
(secondary intention) for hand lacerations less than 2 cm in length and uncomplicated by
underlying joint, tendon, fracture, or nerve injury or medical conditions that would affect
healing (Quinn et al., 2002). There were no differences between the groups in cosmetic
appearance, return to activity, or infection. As many hand lacerations are small and
uncomplicated, this study suggests non-surgical management for non-gaping uncomplicated
lacerations of the hand may be appropriate. Although, a comprehensive recommendation
for working populations is not made as the clinician should consider tensile forces on the
wound and other environmental exposures resultant from occupational duties that likely
reduce the ability to use non-surgical management for some patients in making a treatment
decision. There are no quality RCTs of upper extremity wound lacerations comparing suture
repair with healing by secondary intent for gaping lacerations exceeding 2cm in linear
length. However, wound closure most commonly by suture techniques has been long
performed making suture repair the basis for other comparison studies. Therefore, although
there is a lack of supporting studies, suturing is considered first line for laceration repair,
with the strength of other repair recommendations made against using secondary intent in
non-infected wounds. Various suture techniques have been described to provide the
approximation of skin margins. However, there is a relative lack of quality studies that are
methodologically sound while also having sufficient follow-up time of greater than one year
to derive robust conclusions regarding the relative merit of different suturing techniques.
Optimal results are thought to be dependent on skin edge eversion to eliminate depressed
scarring, elimination of dead space and minimization of tension of individual sutures to
avoid tissue necrosis. Common techniques include simple interrupted, vertical mattress, and
running sutures. There are two moderate-quality studies of suture techniques, although
there were no direct comparisons between the common techniques. Two versions of
vertical mattress were compared with no difference in outcomes in a low quality study
(Jones et al., 1993). Simple running cutaneous suture was compared with running

subcutaneous sutures (removed at 14 days and not removed non-absorbable suture) and
subcutaneous polygalactin (absorbable) running suture for treatment of post-elliptical
excisions, rather than traumatic lacerations (Alam et al., 2006). There were short and
intermediate advantages of polygalactin vs. polypropylene subcutaneous sutures, which
disappeared at 9 months. This study, however, may not be generalizable to laceration
repairs. Comparison of single layer vs. bi-layer repair for minor lacerations showed no
difference in cosmetic results, although this was a study of facial lacerations, and may not
be applicable even though the face is considered cosmetically more sensitive than the
extremity (Singer et al., 2005). Therefore, there is no quality evidence to recommend one
technique over another, and there are multiple scenarios that one technique might offer
technical advantage over another, so that the operator focus may best be on principles for
assuring optimal results. There is also a lack of quality data comparing suture types for
extremity laceration repair. The available cosmetic studies are both methodologically weak
and have inadequate follow-up times to derive clinically meaningful differences on cosmesis
. One moderate-quality study showed comparability of absorbable catgut to nylon sutures
for simple repair (Karounis et al., 2004). A low-quality study showed no difference between
absorbable suture with nylon suture . A systematic review in pediatric and adult populations
of absorbable vs. non-absorbable sutures did not find superiority of one over the other .
Another moderate-quality study compared Teno Fix® repair, which uses a multifilament
stainless steel suture, to a simple repair with cruciate suture for flexor tendon lacerations
and found that repairs with the Teno Fix® had lower rupture rates and similar functional
outcomes when compared with conventional repair (Su et al., 2005). Thus, there is
insufficient quality evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of absorbable
or non-absorbable suture material for superficial closure of extremity lacerations. In
addition to evaluating different types of sutures, one moderate-quality study compared
suturing to stapling and concluded that stapling is more cost-effective than sutures.
However, no outcomes measures for cosmetic results or complications were presented
(Orlinsky et al., 1995). There are 17 moderate-quality studies comparing tissue adhesives
with standard suture repair of routine extremity lacerations that have shown at least
equivalent or superior cosmetic results with no statistically significant increase in infections,
dehiscence rates, or other complications (Limpaphayom et al., 2004, Bruns et al., 1998,
Bruns et al., 1996, Handschel et al., 2006, Holger et al., 2004, Quinn et al., 1997, Quinn et al.,
2002, Shamiyeh et al., 2001, Simon et al., 1997, Simon et al., 1998, Singer et al., 2002, Singer
et al., 2002, Sinha et al., 2001, Toriumi et al., 1998, Goktas et al., 2002, Mattick et al., 2002,
Zempsky et al., 2001). Advantages to using tissue adhesives also include elimination of the
need for local anesthesia, significant reduction of repair time, and ease of performing the
procedure saving on visit time over suture repair. Disadvantages of wound characteristics
(especially depth and length) and occupational tasks requiring considerable tension are
considerable in working populations and are discussed below. The most commonly used
tissue adhesive is octylcyanoacrylate also known as Dermabond®. The other major glue is Nbutyl 2-cyanoacrylate, also known as Histoacryl® and Histoacryl Blue®, which has a blue tint

other scarring disorders, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid or other immunosuppressant use,
or debilitating illnesses. Thus, the results of equivalency in treatment may not be applicable
to many with work-related upper extremity lacerations. Tissue adhesive was also compared
to the use of Steri-Strips in 7 moderate-quality studies as either a primary comparison
(Mattick et al., 2002, Zempsky et al., 1997) or as part of the “standard care” treatment arm
(Bruns et al., 1998, Shamiyeh et al., 2001, Singer et al., 2002, Singer et al., 2002). In each
trial, Steri-Strips were found to be equivalent in efficacy to tissue adhesive with the same
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Tissue adhesive was also compared with the use of skin
stapling in 5 moderate quality studies (Singer et al., 1998, Bruns et al., 1996, Singer et al.,
2002, Singer et al., 2002) as part of the non-surgical treatment arms. In each of these
studies, the results were equivalent in all outcomes measures. Therefore, there is strong
evidence that tissue adhesives, skin stapling, and adhesive tapes are effective in the repair
of routine lacerations of the upper extremity provided they are used on skin areas that are
not subject to significant tension (i.e., joints, creases in hand, etc.). In appropriate cases,
these have the added advantage of reduced operator or procedural time and material costs
compared with suture repair.

SEMI-OCCLUSIVE OR OCCLUSIVE DRESSING OF WOUNDS
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of semi-occlusive or occlusive dressing
for wounds. The use of semi-occlusive dressings is commonly used although there is little
evidence that this practice improves infection rate or cosmetic outcomes. Dressings may be
more indicated based on potential contamination at work or other workplace exposures.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There is no quality evidence on proper wound dressing of upper extremity lacerations, the
timing and necessity of wound recheck by a health professional, and the timing of suture
removal. Upon completion of wound repair, common practice remotely was to cover the
wound with semi-occlusive non-adherent dressing for 24 to 48 hours with topical
antimicrobial product (Howell et al., 1992). Based on two reports from the 1960s, it was
common practice is to keep the wound moist, which was thought to promote reepithelialization, and reduce risk of infection. However, there are no quality trials supporting
this practice and some question the concept (Hinman et al., 1963, Jones, 2005, Winter,
1962). Current practice is to minimize the use of these dressings for most lacerations to
promote movement and use of injured body part(s) and frequently involves the use of
bacitracin or poly-antibiotic ointment.
There is one related moderate-quality study comparing infection rates after dermatological
excision and repair of wounds that were either left uncovered after 12 hours and allowing
normal bathing vs. those that were kept dry under bandage for 48 hours. In this postsurgical population of 857 patients, there was no statistical difference in the infection rate,
demonstrating that wounds can be uncovered and allowed to get wet in the first 48 hours
without significant risk (Heal et al., 2006). However, it is unclear if traumatic lacerations
would react different from surgically controlled wounds so no recommendation is made for
or against use of occlusive or semi-occlusive dressings. Physician discretion is indicated
dependent on the wound and characteristics of workplace exposures of the wound.
Wound care instructions are usually provided verbally or in written format including
information on monitoring for signs of infection. There are no studies on post-repair
infection rates comparing persons who have received verbal or written instructions with
those that return in 24 to 48 hours for a wound check. However, there is one case series of

377

433 patients that on follow-up evaluation were asked to rate their wound based on wound
care instructions provided for signs of infection. On physician examination, 21 were deemed
to have a wound infection. Of these 21, 10 patients did not rate their wound as infected
giving a false negative rate of 48% (10/21), although the false positive rate was low at 8%. It
is, however, uncertain if these would have resolved or resulted in serious infection, as the
follow-up visit occurred at different times, including suture removal. Thus, providing wound
care instructions is likely useful, costs little except additional clinician time, and may prevent
serious infections from going undetected. Routine wound check at 24 to 72 hours is also a
common practice and is recommended for complicated wound repair, those that are
contaminated or with suspicion of retained foreign bodies, already infected at initial
presentation, or if patient is working in unclean environments (Patel et al., 2007).
Suture removal for optimal results in upper extremity lacerations is not well defined by
quality studies. Common practice is removal of sutures or staples in cosmetically sensitive
areas with low tension in 3 to 5 days, 1 week in lower tension areas on the upper
extremities, and 10 to 14 days in high-tension areas (Singer et al., 1998, Patel et al., 2007,
DeBoard et al., 2007). Wounds closed with cyanoacrylates or surgical tape are less likely to
have concerns and follow-up may not be needed except for documentation of healing for
patients in workers compensation systems.

MALLET FINGER
OVERVIEW
Mallet fracture or mallet finger is a common fracture-dislocation injury of the distal phalanx
involving loss of continuity of the extensor tendon over the distal interphalangeal joint. This
common hand injury results in a flexion deformity of the distal finger joint and may lead to
an imbalance between flexion and extension forces more proximally in the digit. In cases
where there is hardware placed, subsequent hardware removal is indicated in cases of: (1)
protruding hardware, (2) pain attributed to the hardware, (3) broken hardware on imaging,
and/or (4) positive anesthetic injection response.
Mallet finger is readily diagnosed based on the presentation of inability to extend the distal
interphalangeal joint, generally in the context of trauma or distal interphalangeal joint
arthrosis (780). The patient is unable to extend the distal phalangeal segment. Swelling often
signifies a fracture fragment, while most are extensor tendon ruptures (781) and have no
significant swelling.
The mechanism of injury most typically involves forcefully striking the tip of the extended
digit on an object (e.g., balls caught by the hands in sports), as well as from falls (609). Unless
there is a fracture, most cases present without significant, post-traumatic pain. Some occur
without any trauma and are thought to mostly occur with osteoarthrosis and Heberden’s
nodes or other chronic joint pathology.
Mallet finger is a common occupational and sports injury (782), although it may occur with
minimal apparent trauma (780). The injury involves rupture of the extensor mechanism of a
digit at the distal upper extremity joint with or without fracture of the distal phalangeal
segment. The mechanism of injury most typically involves forcefully striking the tip of the
extended digit on an object including balls, or from falls (609).
This injury requires splinting; however, whether there is any need for work limitations
involving the digit other than a requirement to wear the splint continuously is unclear.
Provided there is no difficulty with wearing the splint, no work limitations are generally
needed.
Work-relatedness is generally non-controversial and is based on having an acute accident at
work. However, in cases without precipitating injury, work-relatedness is speculative.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Mallet finger is a clinical diagnosis with a characteristic presentation of inability to extend
the distal segment when the extensor tendon is damaged.
X-RAYS FOR MALLET FINGER
Recommended
X-rays are recommended in most cases of mallet finger to determine if a fracture is present
and to what extent.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating the use of x-rays for mallet finger. X-rays may assist
in identifying fractures and the magnitude of the involvement of the joint surface, which if
large enough, alters management to surgery. It is reasonable to omit x-rays if there is no
swelling or tenderness.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: x-ray, computed
tomography, radiograph, mallet finger, baseball finger; diagnostic, diagnosis, sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and predictive value of tests,
efficacy, and efficiency. We found and reviewed 22 articles in PubMed, 10 in Scopus, 2 in
CINAHL, 0 in Cochrane Library, and 243 from Google Scholar. We considered for inclusion 0
from PubMed, 1 from Scopus, 0 from CINAHL, 0 from Cochrane Library, 2 from Google
Scholar, and 0 from other sources. Zero articles met the inclusion criteria.
ULTRASOUND TO DIAGNOSE MALLET FINGER
Not Recommended
Ultrasound is not recommended to diagnose mallet finger.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating the use of ultrasound to diagnose mallet finger.
While ultrasound has been used for imaging (Bianchi, 2008, Kleinbaum et al., 2005), there is
no evidence it alters treatment or prognosis and x-ray studies appear sufficient for
diagnostic purposes. Thus, ultrasound is not recommended to diagnose mallet finger.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
Care usually involves a splint and follow-up visits. Patients require a few appointments to
reinforce importance of splinting and of not removing the splint unsupported. Multiple
appointments are generally not required. Large fracture fragments are rare (781,783,784,785,786)
and necessitate surgery.
EXERCISE FOR THE TREATMENT OF MALLET FINGER
Not Recommended
Exercise is not indicated acutely and most patients with mallet finger do not require
participation in an exercise program. However, patients usually require careful education
about splinting (see Education above). For patients with residual deficits, particularly postoperatively, see the carpal tunnel syndrome recommendations.

SPLINTS FOR ACUTE OR SUBACUTE MALLET FINGER
Recommended
Extension splinting with the joint in a neutral or hyperextended position is moderately
recommended for treatment of acute or subacute mallet finger (Maitra et al., 1993, Warren
et al., 1988).
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence High
Rationale
There are five moderate-quality RCTs incorporated in this analysis. Splints must hold the
finger in continuous, full extension for a minimum duration of 6 weeks (Hong, 2005, Smit et
al., 2010). Some protocols involve 8 weeks, while some involve nocturnal use for an
additional 2 to 4 weeks (Maitra et al., 1993, Kinninmonth et al., 1986, Warren et al., 1988,
Hong, 2005, Betts-Symonds et al., 1982, Chan, 2002, Valdes et al., 2015). There are many
different types of splints and no quality evidence of the unequivocal superiority of one
versus another (Handoll et al., 2004, O'Brien et al., 2011, Pike et al., 2010). A padded
aluminum splint was reportedly superior compared to a Stack (pre-fabricated plastic) splint
due to easier fit and fewer skin complications (Maitra et al., 1993). Another trial found the

Stack splint superior to the Abouna splint (Warren et al., 1988). Extension must be
maintained even if the splint is removed for skin hygiene, which is often one of the times
non-compliance occurs and is believed to cause many of the treatment failures (Handoll et
al., 2004). One quality study suggested better outcomes with fixation for patients presenting
with delayed treatment (Auchincloss, 1982).
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: splint, splints,

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SPLINT WEAR
Recommended
It is recommended that careful instructions on splint wear be provided to patients.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating the use of instructions for splint wear for mallet
finger. However, instructions appear critical for preventing treatment failures and are thus
recommended.

SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR MALLET FINGER WITH DISPLACED FRACTURES
Recommended
Surgical treatment with a fixation wire is recommended for patients with displaced fractures
involving more than one third to one half of the articular surface of the DIP joint.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
Quality studies to determine which patients with mallet finger would be optimal for surgical
interventions are not currently available (Handoll et al., 2004). One study reported a nonstatistically significant trend suggesting preference for fixation among those presenting late
for treatment (Auchincloss, 1982); however, the dropout rate was high. A low-quality study
also suggested no difference in splinting outcomes among those presenting late (Garberman
et al., 1994). Surgery is invasive, has relatively few adverse effects for this disorder, and is
high cost; however, surgery is recommended for these select patients.

NONSPECIFIC HAND, WRIST, OR FOREARM PAIN
OVERVIEW
Non-specific pain is thought to be common in initial presentations in primary occupational
health clinical settings, although work-relatedness is naturally unclear for condition that is
not well defined (787). The initial step is a careful history and physical examination,
particularly to attempt to ascertain a specific musculoskeletal disorder.
Patients most commonly give a history of gradual onset of pain or other symptoms in the
absence of discrete trauma. Symptoms are most often in the forearm, and frequently are
not well localized.
The examination is generally without any unequivocally objective evidence. Instead,
tenderness is most often the only physical examination finding. Qualitative muscle strength
testing may be weak compared with the unaffected side. Precise documentation of the
location of the pain should be made with consideration for photographing the location for
future reference. In cases where the pain does not migrate, the probability of specifically
defined pathology is believed to increase.
Non-specific hand/wrist/forearm pain typically occurs in the absence of discrete trauma.
Instead, it frequently occurs in settings of high physical job demands or ill-defined
exposures. This is a “diagnostic” category to be utilized when symptoms are present, but in
the absence of an identified, specific disorder. Most cases will resolve without significant
difficulty. If there is no improvement after several weeks of treatment, focused diagnostic
testing should be considered. Non-specific pain lasting more than 2 months is fairly rare.
The search for a specific diagnosis should include proximal pathology including spine-related
(e.g., radiculopathy, spinal tumor, infection) as well as psychological disorders particularly
when widespread symptoms are elicited or a pattern or recurrent unexplained illnesses is
present (see Chronic Pain Guideline).

Patients may require 1 to 3 appointments depending on the severity or the pain and need
for workplace limitations.
Non-specific pain may or may not require work limitations depending on task demands. For
patients with high exposures, work limitations are more likely to be helpful. However, in the
absence of high force or high force combined with other ergonomic factors, work limitations
are at times counterproductive because they enforce debility and do not produce
meaningful improvements. In those settings, work limitations may be trialed; however, in
the absence of improvement, resumption of regular work activities may be helpful for longterm functional gain.
Work-relatedness is unclear as there are no quality studies of this condition. However, it is
generally recommended that the condition be treated and it will generally resolve. Thus, in
the absence of costly testing and/or treatment protocols or prolonged duration, the
condition is generally non-controversial.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Non-specific pain is not a discrete diagnosis, per se, but the absence of a discrete diagnosis.
RHEUMATOLOGICAL STUDIES FOR ARTHRALGIAS
Recommended
Rheumatological studies are recommended for evaluation of patients with persistent
unexplained arthralgias or tenosynovitis.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Indications
Persistent unexplained arthralgias or tenosynovitis.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Repeat studies may be required after passage of time as some patients, particularly those
with less severe diseases, tend to develop positive antibodies after months to years.
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating rheumatological studies for evaluation of arthralgias;
however, these studies have been helpful in diagnosing numerous rheumatological
disorders. Arthrocentesis is also helpful for securing important diagnoses, such as septic
arthritis and crystalline arthropathies.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
RELATIVE REST FOR ACUTE NON-SPECIFIC HAND, WRIST, OR FOREARM PAIN
Recommended
Relative rest is a recommended treatment in select cases of acute non-specific hand, wrist,
or forearm pain particularly where there are high ergonomic exposures (high force or high
force combined with other risk factors).
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies and treatment is empiric. For patients with high ergonomic
exposures, relative rest may be helpful. This intervention is not invasive, has low adverse
effects, and for short periods is low to moderate cost; thus, it is recommended.
Evidence

EXERCISE FOR NON-SPECIFIC HAND, WRIST, AND FOREARM PAIN
Not Recommended
Exercise is not generally indicated for acute, nonspecific hand, wrist, and forearm pain.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operative, appointments should be scheduled
generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there has been functional improvements yet there
are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is often
helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week appointments)
may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe, and there is
ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g., increased
grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities, increased
duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are appropriate when
there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent objective functional
gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the therapy.
Rationale
Exercise is not generally indicated acutely. One moderate-quality study of mostly chronic
patients found no differences between two types of exercise programs, but had no control
group (van Eijsden-Besseling et al., 2008). Many patients with chronic findings, functional
deficits and post-operative patients require some appointments to at minimum help
institute a home exercise program. For those with residual deficits, particularly postoperatively, see section on post-operative rehabilitation for patients with carpal tunnel
syndrome.

There is no recommendation for or against the use of splinting for treatment of acute or
subacute non-specific hand, wrist, or forearm pain.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)

NSAIDS FOR ACUTE OR SUBACUTE NON-SPECIFIC HAND, WRIST, OR FOREARM PAIN
Recommended
NSAIDs are recommended for control of pain associated with acute or subacute non-specific
hand, wrist, or forearm pain.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Acute or subacute non-specific hand, wrist, or forearm pain.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Scheduled dosage rather than as needed is generally preferable.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution of pain, lack of efficacy, development of adverse effects, particularly
gastrointestinal.
Rationale
There are two moderate-quality studies evaluating the use of NSAIDs or acetaminophen for
treatment of non-specific lower extremity pain (Muckle, 1974, Muckle, 1977), which is
presumably analogous to upper extremity pain and showed benefits (see Ankle and Foot
Disorders Guideline). These medications may relieve pain and increase function. They are
not invasive, have few adverse effects in employed populations, and are low cost. Thus, they
are recommended.

PHYSICAL OR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC HAND, WRIST, OR FOREARM PAIN
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of physical or occupational therapy for
treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic non-specific hand, wrist, or forearm pain.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating any of the physical or occupational therapy
modalities for treatment of non-specific hand, wrist, or forearm pain. (A case series of hand
rehabilitation with occupational therapy services suggested benefits of occupational therapy
for patients with heterogenous disorders.) Thus, treatments administered are empiric.
These treatments are not invasive, have few adverse effects, but are moderate to high cost
depending on number of treatments. They are generally not indicated for initial treatment.
They may be more reasonable for more persistent cases. Trials of these modalities may be
helpful in cases that do not resolve with initial treatment methods outlined above.
However, these treatments are empiric and thus the success may be limited. Thus, there is
no recommendation for or against these modalities.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms physical therapy,
occupational therapy, nonspecific, non-specific, hand pain, wrist pain, forearm pain;
controlled clinical trial, controlled trials, randomized controlled trial, randomized controlled

RADIAL NERVE ENTRAPMENT AT THE WRIST
OVERVIEW
Radial nerve entrapment usually presents as radial nerve palsies affecting the hand and
wrist, most commonly occurring at points along the course of the arm and forearm, well
proximal to the wrist (788,789,790). The medical history should include a search for sensory
symptoms. Symptoms may also include pain over the course of the nerve.
Successful localization of radial nerve entrapment can frequently be accomplished through a
careful history and physical exam. The medical history should search for sensory symptoms
including paresthesias with precision of the location of the paresthesias to a typical radial
nerve distribution on the dorsal hand, particularly in the first dorsal web space (789).
Symptoms may also include pain over the nerve. Distinguishing from other sources of
sensory symptoms is usually possible, particularly including radiculopathies and other
entrapment syndromes. An assessment of motor symptoms, including wrist extensor
weakness as well as wrist drop, are also helpful, particularly in conjunction with absence of
weakness in other distributions.
The physical examination attempts to localize the site of nerve entrapment and should
include sensory (especially sensation) and motor components (movement, range of motion,
strength, reflexes) to localize the entrapment. Comparisons to the unaffected limb should
be made. Differentiation from de Quervain’s tenosynovitis is a primary differential
diagnostic consideration, yet Finkelstein’s is not particularly helpful as it may be positive
with both conditions.
There are no quality studies linking radial nerve entrapment with work factors, although
direct, significant trauma would be a presumptive cause. Radial nerve palsies affecting the
hand and wrist usually occur at points along the course of the arm and forearm, well
proximal to the wrist (788,789,791). Upper arm lesions are generally associated with humeral
fractures and related trauma or subsequent callous formation. Radial Tunnel Syndrome, or
posterior interosseous nerve entrapment, occurs in the proximal forearm (see Elbow
Disorders Guideline). Wartenberg’s Syndrome, or radial sensory nerve entrapment in the
distal forearm, is uncommon (791).
Compression of the radial sensory nerve has been attributed to wearing a tight wrist or
forearm band, anomalous brachioradialis tendon (790,792), repeated wrist flexion and ulnar
deviation, external compression and trauma (791,793,794), or from mass or bony lesions (795).
Case studies have also hypothesized an association with de Quervain’s tenosynovitis, which
occurs in roughly 50% of cases diagnosed with Wartenberg Syndrome (796).
Job modifications are thought to be needed in a few cases to facilitate recovery.
Radial neuropathy at the wrist is reportedly caused by local mechanical compression of the
nerve at the wrist from external trauma, a tight wrist or forearm band, or anomalous
brachioradialis tendon (790,792). It has been attributed to repeated wrist flexion and ulnar

deviation, however, there is no quality epidemiological evidence and thus when occurring in
the absence of trauma, work-relatedness is speculative. There may be a better basis for
work-relatedness for radial neuropathy with entrapment just above the wrist in the context
of concomitant de Quervain’s tenosynovitis that is considered work-related.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Electrodiagnostic studies can confirm the diagnosis of a radial nerve motor neuropathy (788).
Ultrasound has been used as an adjunct to electrophysiological studies for evaluation of
radial nerve neuropathy (172).
ELECTRODIAGNOSTIC TESTING FOR RADIAL NERVE MOTOR NEUROPATHY
Recommended
Electrodiagnostic testing is recommended to confirm clinical suspicion of a radial nerve
motor neuropathy.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There is no quality evidence available for the use of electrodiagnostic testing; however, it is
recommended as an objective test to evaluate radial nerve motor neuropathy (Carlson et
al., 1999, Eaton et al., 1992, Corwin, 2006). However, studies need to be performed by welltrained electrodiagnosticians, preferably certified by the American Board of
Electrodiagnostic Medicine.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: electrodiagnostic
study, nerve conduction study, electromyography, radial nerve entrapment, radial tunnel
syndrome, diagnostic, diagnosis, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and predictive value of tests, efficacy, and efficiency. We found and
reviewed 6 articles in PubMed, 86 in Scopus, 0 in CINAHL, 1 in Cochrane Library, and 160
from Google Scholar. We considered for inclusion 2 from PubMed, 1 from Scopus, 0 from
CINAHL, 0 from Cochrane Library, 0 from Google Scholar, and 0 from other sources. Of the 3
articles considered for inclusion 2 diagnostic studies met the inclusion criteria.
DIAGNOSTIC ULTRASOUND FOR RADIAL NERVE NEUROPATHY
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against ultrasound to confirm clinical suspicion of a
radial nerve neuropathy.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate

Rationale
There is no quality evidence available that diagnostic ultrasound materially alters the ability
to diagnose radial nerve entrapments and thus there is no recommendation for or against
diagnostic ultrasound.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: Ultrasound ,
diagnostic, diagnosis, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive
value, and predictive value of tests, efficacy, and efficiency. We found and reviewed 7
articles in PubMed, 93 in Scopus, 0 in CINAHL, 0 in Cochrane Library, and 8540 from Google
Scholar, and 0 from other sources. We considered for inclusion 2 from PubMed, 0 from
Scopus, 0 from CINAHL, 0 from Cochrane Library, 0 from Google Scholar, and 0 from other
sources. One article met the inclusion criteria.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
Overall, the literature suggests patients most often appear to respond to non-operative
treatments including no treatment; avoidance of exposures thought to be contributing (if
present); avoidance of wearing a watch, tight jewelry or shirt sleeves on the affected side;
corticosteroid injection (797); and temporary thumb spica splinting (796,798).
MODIFICATION OF WORK ACTIVITIES FOR RADIAL NERVE ENTRAPMENT
Recommended
Removal from job tasks thought to have caused radial neuropathy at the wrist is
recommended.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Indications
Patients with radial neuropathies thought to be caused by an ongoing job physical exposure
(e.g., striking the radial nerve).
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution, lack of improvement, or desire of the patient to remove limitations.
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating the modification of work activities for radial
neuropathies at the wrist. However, where occupational factors are significant, a trial of
removal from that type of work may be indicated.

WRIST EXTENSION OR THUMB SPICA SPLINT FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC RADIAL
NERVE COMPRESSION NEUROPATHY
Recommended
The use of a wrist extension or thumb spica splint is recommended for treatment of acute,
subacute, or chronic radial nerve compression neuropathy.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
Splints appear to be helpful for many cases and thus are recommended, particularly wrist
extension splints.
Evidence

NSAIDS FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC RADIAL NERVE COMPRESSION NEUROPATHY
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of NSAIDs to control pain associated with
acute, subacute, or chronic radial nerve compression neuropathy.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
Although there are no quality studies on which to rely for the treatment of distal radial
neuropathies, non-invasive options are available and have few adverse effects and are low
cost. NSAIDs are not unreasonable and are recommended by some (Plate et al., 2000);
however, evidence of efficacy is lacking, NSAIDs do not work particularly well for other
neuropathies (see Chronic Pain guideline); thus, other options are generally preferable.

GLUCOCORTICOSTEROIDS FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC RADIAL NERVE
COMPRESSION AT THE WRIST
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of oral and injected glucocorticosteroids
for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic radial nerve compression at the wrist.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
The mechanism(s) of efficacy of glucocorticosteroids is unclear (Rinkel et al., 2013). If the
mechanism involves tendon sheaths and related structures, then these medications would
be predicted to be ineffective for distal radial neuropathies. However, if through another
mechanism of action directly involving the nerve sheath, then these injections could be
effective. These treatments are not invasive to low invasive, have few adverse effects, and
are low to moderate cost. They are recommended, with the exception of NSAIDs and
injections for which there is no evidence of efficacy and concerns that the available
literature does not support those treatments as efficacious.

MANIPULATION AND MOBILIZATION, MASSAGE, FRICTION MASSAGE, OR ACUPUNCTURE)
FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC RADIAL NEUROPATHY AT THE WRIST
No Recommendation
There is no recommendation for or against the use of physical methods for treatment of
acute, subacute, or chronic radial neuropathy at the wrist including iontophoresis, selfapplication of ice or heat, manipulation and mobilization, massage, friction massage, or

EXERCISE FOR RADIAL NERVE ENTRAPMENT AT THE WRIST

Exercise is not generally indicated acutely. Many patients with chronic findings, functional
deficits and post-operative patients require some appointments to at minimum help

Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operative, appointments should be scheduled
generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there has been functional improvements yet there
are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is often
helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week appointments)
may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe, and there is
ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g., increased
grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities, increased
duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are appropriate when
there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent objective functional
gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the therapy.

ANTIEMETICS
See the ACOEM Antiemetics Guideline.

TRIANGULAR FIBROCARTILAGE COMPLEX (TFCC) TEARS
OVERVIEW
Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears are frequent wrist injuries involving the
cartilaginous meniscus between the radius and ulna with symptoms often described as
occurring on the ulnar side of the wrist joint. TFCC is apparently susceptible to the same
anatomic, pathophysiologic, and degenerative issues as the knee menisci. Vascular supply is
similarly analogous to a meniscus with radial penetration into the meniscal periphery and
central avascularity (799,800) and evidence that degeneration increases with age (801). Since
abnormalities are commonly found on MRI and/or arthrography (802), indications for surgical
interventions are somewhat unclear.
Patients commonly complain of non-radiating ulnar sided pain and clicking. It is important to
correlate the symptoms with the physical examination and mechanism of injury since MRI
studies suggest TFCC tears are both prevalent while also apparently frequently
asymptomatic (799,803,804). Ulnar deviation with axial loading tends to increase pain. A “click”
or “clunk” in the ulnar wrist joint may be reproduced with forearm rotation
(supination/pronation). Commonly reported mechanisms of injury include a fall on an
outstretched hand (805,806,807) as well as sports (808,809). Thus, some work-related accidents are
reported causes of these tears. Those with occupational cases will tend toward symptomatic
onset after a discrete traumatic event such as a slip and fall.
The exam may reveal dorso-ulnar wrist joint tenderness that is not focally tender over an
extensor compartment. Swelling is generally not present, although it may be present with
an acute, large tear. The examiner should generally attempt to reproduce catching or
Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

404

snapping in the ulnar wrist joint, either by having the patient place the wrist into a position
that elicits the symptoms and/or moving the wrist and forearm through a combined
supination movement with simultaneous movement of the wrist from flexion to extension.
Patients generally require from 1 to 6 appointments, depending on severity and need for
workplace limitations. Greater numbers of appointments may be required for evaluating
and treatment pain and monitoring function and work status over time. Severe TFCC tears,
especially those that either are immobilized for many weeks or undergo surgery may
require occupational or physical therapy typically for teaching mobilization exercises and
strengthening exercises.
TFCC tears appear to occur either with acute discrete traumatic events and/or as
degenerative cartilaginous changes. A primary focus of the patient history is ascertaining
whether the TFCC is significantly torn, and if so, whether it is sufficiently symptomatic to
require intervention(s). Following the patient’s symptoms for healing without immediate
surgical intervention is generally the most common approach. Some do not heal, continue
to be symptomatic and do well with surgical repair or removal.
Work-relatedness of an acute TFCC tear sustained in the course of a slip, trip, fall, or heavy
and awkward lift at work is generally considered an occupational injury and is not usually
controversial, although apportionment is a consideration in applicable jurisdictions due to
the prevalence of pre-existing degenerative abnormalities, as well as presence and degree
of ulnar positive variance (longer ulna than radius, which is thought to be a risk factor for
TFCC tears). However, other TFCC tears occurring without an acute, inciting event are of
unclear etiology, as the injuries are more analogous to a disease or disorder and there is no
quality epidemiological evidence to link them with work. Chronic TFCC tears in the presence
of a positive ulnar variance are generally not thought to be occupational.

DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA
The history should include ulnar wrist joint pain and a catching, snapping or popping
sensation in the wrist with movement. The physical examination should reproduce these
symptoms. Imaging studies should be consistent with a triangular fibrocartilage complex
(TFCC) tear of sufficient magnitude to explain the symptoms. Other TFCC tears do not have
all these features, yet are found in the course of imaging for wrist abnormalities (799,803,804).
These other tears generally represent asymptomatic prevalent tears discovered through
imaging. Treatment of those tears is usually not indicated. TFCC tears are most commonly
classified by the Palmer classification system (806) which has been utilized to develop
treatment recommendations (see Table 5). However, overlap may be present between the
types in particular due to concomitant degenerative and traumatic issues.

*Adapted from (607,803,810).
**Surgery of these is felt to be rarely necessary due to vascular supply.
***Degenerative joint disease risks include body mass index, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, other inflammatory arthropathies,
and repeated forceful wrist use.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Diagnostic arthroscopy is often combined with surgical repair (see Surgical Considerations).
X-RAYS TO DIAGNOSE TRIANGULAR FIBROCARTILAGE COMPLEX (TFCC) TEARS

Level of confidence Moderate
Indications
Suspected TFCC tear and/or to rule out other sources of wrist pain.
Copyright ©2025 Reed Group, LLC

406

Frequency/Dose/Duration
Obtaining x-rays once is generally sufficient.
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating x-rays for the diagnosis of triangular fibrocartilage
complex (TFCC) tears. Some patients do not require initial x-rays and can be managed
clinically. However, x-rays may assist particularly in ruling out other potential sources of
wrist pain. They are also indicated for those who fail to improve or have other symptoms
suggesting consideration of other potential diagnoses. X-rays also assist with analysis for
evidence of other conditions such as osteoarthrosis. Positive ulnar variance (an ulna that
extends more distally than the radius) is thought to increase risk.
MR ARTHROGRAPHY OR MRI TO DIAGNOSE TRIANGULAR FIBROCARTILAGE COMPLEX
(TFCC) TEARS
Recommended
MR arthrography or MRI is recommended to diagnose triangular fibrocartilage complex
(TFCC) tears.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating MR arthrography or MRI for the diagnosis of
triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears. MR arthrography is thought to be superior.
Traditional arthrography without MRI has mostly been replaced by MR arthrography and
MRI (Chung et al., 1996, Golimbu et al., 1989, Potter et al., 1997, Schers et al., 1995, Skahen
et al., 1990, Slutsky, 2007). Virtual MR arthroscopy is in development, but its utility is not
yet demonstrated (Sahin et al., 2004).

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
Splinting has been used for treatment of TFCC tears (811) as have ice, heat, and rest. Overthe-counter medications are generally helpful. Prescription medications may be needed in
moderate to severe cases.
TFCC tears may not require work limitations. However, the more forceful the work and
more significant the symptoms, the more likely work limitations will be needed. Work
limitations typically include reducing forceful use, wrist rotation, or other activities that
provoke symptoms.

RELATIVE REST FOR ACUTE, SUBACUTE, OR CHRONIC TRIANGULAR FIBROCARTILAGE
COMPLEX (TFCC) TEARS
Recommended
Relative rest is recommended for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic triangular
fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating relative rest for TFCC tears. However, limitations are
often needed for more symptomatic cases. Though not invasive, limitations can be
moderate to high cost over time; however, relative rest may preclude the need for surgical
intervention. These treatments may help with symptomatic relief, are not invasive, have no
adverse effects, and are not costly and are recommended.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL and
Cochrane Library without date limits using the following terms: Rest; relative rest /
Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears; controlled clinical trial, controlled trials,
randomized controlled trial, randomized controlled trials, random allocation, random*,

SPLINTING FOR MODERATE OR SEVERE ACUTE OR SUBACUTE TRIANGULAR
FIBROCARTILAGE COMPLEX (TFCC) TEARS
Recommended
Splinting is recommended for treatment of moderate or severe acute or subacute triangular
fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears, particularly to reduce forearm rotation.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)

Rationale
There is no evidence of the efficacy of wrist splints to treat acute, subacute, or chronic TFCC
tears (knee menisci, which are structurally similar, appear to heal with use). Yet, there may
be cases where a wrist splint seems helpful and others have recommended immobilization
(see Table 5). Splints may help with avoiding aggravating activities or actions that provoke

injuries.

●
ulnar-sided wrist pain made worse with activity,
●
ulnar carpal joint tenderness that is not focally tender over an extensor
compartment, and
●
increasing pain with ulnar deviation with axial loading and/or grind.
A confirmatory diagnosis additionally requires an MRI or MR arthrogram consistent with a
TFCC tear.
Nonoperative treatments include:
●
activity modification,
●
splinting,
●
oral nonopioid analgesics and/or topical NSAIDs.
Surgical repair considerations are failure of approximately 3-6 weeks of nonoperative
treatment.

There are no quality studies evaluating surgical repair for TFCC tears. Location of the TFCC
tear is thought to be related to prognosis with peripheral tears having a better probability of
success with non-surgical treatment due to vascular supply; however, central tears also may
become asymptomatic (Palmer, 1990). Arthroscopic repair is most typically used, with
excellent or good results reported in 74% of a case series of 35 patients (Estrella et al., 2007)
and other estimates of success up to 93% (Bednar et al., 1994, Corso et al., 1997, de Araujo
et al., 1996, Ruch et al., 2003, Westkaemper et al., 1998), although open repairs may be

are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is often
helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week appointments)
may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe, and there is
ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g., increased
grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities, increased
duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are appropriate when
there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent objective functional
gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the therapy.

ULNAR NERVE ENTRAPMENT AT THE WRIST
OVERVIEW
Ulnar nerve entrapment involves delayed conduction of the ulnar nerve combined with
symptoms. It has no quality evidence of work-relatedness, but theories of work-relatedness
are proposed. Guyon’s canal is the space in which the ulnar nerve accompanied by the ulnar
artery traverses the wrist. It is anatomically defined as the proximal medial wall formed by
the pisiform, the distal lateral wall formed by the hook of the hamate, the floor formed by
the flexor retinaculum and transverse carpal ligament, and the roof formed by the
pisohamate carpal ligament (812). Within the canal, the nerve bifurcates into the superficial
(sensory) branch, and the deep (motor) branch. The superficial branch leaves the canal and
provides a branch to the Palmaris brevis, and then continues subcutaneously to provide
sensation to the fifth digit and the ulnar half of the ring finger. The deep branch loops
around the hook of the hamate, and innervates the abductor digiti quinti, flexor digiti quinti,
lumbricales and interossei as it crosses the palm in a curvilinear direction (813). This canal is
dissimilar to the carpal canal in that the tendons and their tenosynovium do not accompany
the nerve, thus most of the usual postulated causal mechanisms for carpal tunnel syndrome
are not possible. However, use of the hypothenar area of the hand as a hammer is a
postulated occupational mechanism (814,815,816,817,818).
Ulnar nerve entrapment at Guyon’s canal typically first presents with symptoms of
paresthesias followed by late symptoms of weakness. It is reportedly usually not associated
with pain, in contrast with carpal tunnel syndrome that appears to more frequently involve
pain. Patients with traumatic causes of ulnar neuropathy tend to have motor symptoms,
whereas those with idiopathic or non-trauma related causes usually manifest sensory
symptoms (812).
Dependent on the location of the lesion, motor, sensory, or mixed motor-sensory findings
are detectable. Muscle atrophy may be present in the interosseous and hypothenar areas.
Point tenderness may be present. Sensory loss is typically most prominent at the palmar tip
of the 5th finger, in contrast with ulnar neuropathies at the elbow which present with
sensory loss on the palmar and dorsal surfaces of the 5th digit. Motor weakness may be
demonstrated by resisting spreading of the fingers to assess intrinsic muscle strength. A
positive tinel’s is purportedly helpful, but there are no quality studies evaluating the utility
of this clinical test and its utility elsewhere has been questioned. Associated carpal tunnel
compression should also be examined. A vascular exam and auscultation for bruits should
be performed (819), particularly for those cases thought to involve vascular symptoms and
hypothenar hammer-like symptoms.
The location of the lesion affecting the ulnar nerve as it crosses through Guyon’s canal and
the wrist is predictive of clinical symptoms, and has resulted in several classification
schemes. Much of the current literature references the classification scheme proposed by
Wu, which details five locations for lesions identified in collective published case reports.
Lesions proximal to the bifurcation of the ulnar nerve (Type I) will exhibit mixed motor and
sensory involvement. Type II lesions involve only the superficial branch; therefore, clinical
presentations are purely sensory. Type III lesions occur at the outlet of the canal and involve

415

only the deep branch, thus they are purely motor. Type IV lesions occur involving the deep
branch distal to the branch innervating the hypothenar, thus are purely motor with sparing
of the hypothenar muscles. Finally, Type V lesions occur proximal to the branches
innervating the first digital interosseous and abductor pollicis muscles, so that only the distal
motor symptoms are involved (813).
Guyon’s canal syndrome is relatively uncommon, occurring about 20 times less frequently
than ulnar lesions at the elbow (820). Pathological lesions resulting in ulnar entrapment at the
wrist reportedly are associated with concurrent compression of the median nerve in the
carpal tunnel in approximately one-third of patients (812); although there is no quality
evidence that median nerve neuropathy is similarly associated with ulnar nerve
involvement.
Ulnar nerve entrapment at the wrist generally presents as numbness and/or tingling in the
fourth and fifth digits. Certain patients may also experience a weakened grip or difficulty
with finger coordination.
Job modifications are thought to be needed in some cases to facilitate recovery.
Ulnar neuropathy at the wrist is reportedly most often caused by a space occupying lesion
such as ganglion, scar, abnormal ulnar artery or aneurysm, and trauma (793,813,820) (i.e.,
resulting from hamate fracture). Experimental studies suggest that the nerve moves within
the canal with wrist motion, thus traction on the nerve may be possible (794). In a case series
of 47 patients, suspected “cumulative trauma” was attributed to nearly 75% of cases.
However, no definition or quantification of physical factors was given. Activities included
both mechanisms with potential significant localized compression (e.g., cycling, wheelchair
use), those without apparent compression (e.g., piano, truck driving), and those that may or
may not have involved compression (e.g. boiler operator, machine press operator, and steel
cutter) (812). Other described causes include aberrant muscles at the wrist affecting both
median and ulnar nerves (821), and distal neuropathy caused by systemic diseases,
particularly diabetes mellitus and systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) (822,823,824). As there are no
quality epidemiological studies among non-traumatic patients, work-relatedness is
speculative in those populations.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
There is no quality evidence comparing diagnostic testing for this disorder. Most case series
report electrodiagnostic testing assisted in making a diagnosis. The characteristic finding is a
prolonged distal motor latency. One report opined that idiopathic or “cumulative stress”
cases have no characteristic pattern (812). Electrodiagnostic calculations are complicated by
the curvilinear course of the deep motor nerve. Witmer described a technique reducing the
complexity that may be useful to the electromyographer (825).

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
Ulnar neuropathy at the wrist that is not related to trauma, such as from the use of
wheelchair, crutches, or other equipment may benefit initially from non-invasive therapies
and activity adjustments including elimination or mitigation of significant pressure points
(e.g., using padding, etc.) and splinting. Space-occupying lesions with significant motor or
sensory deficits generally have been reported in the literature as requiring surgical
decompression (or needle aspiration of ganglia) with excellent results and rapid recovery of
deficits. In addition to lesion type, consideration may be influenced by the presence of
diabetes mellitus. Although there are not quality studies, there may be a stronger indication
for decompression of peripheral nerve entrapment syndromes in diabetic patients. In a case
series of diabetics with peripheral neuropathy, decompression surgery improved sensory
function in 88% of upper extremities and 69% of lower extremities compared with 32% of
patients that were treated non-operatively (826). Another case series demonstrated similar
results, also favoring recovered function in the upper extremities (827).
MODIFICATION OF WORK ACTIVITIES FOR ULNAR NEUROPATHY

neuropathic pain (see Chronic Pain guideline) is lacking, thus other options are generally
preferable. The mechanism(s) of efficacy of glucocorticosteroids for treatment of CTS and
other disorders is unclear. If the mechanism involves tendon sheaths and related structures,
then these medications would be predicted to be ineffective for ulnar neuropathy at the
wrist. However, if through another mechanism of action directly involving the nerve sheath,
then these injections could be effective. These treatments are not invasive to low invasive,
have few adverse effects and are low to moderate cost. They are recommended with the
exceptions of NSAIDs and injections for which there is no evidence of efficacy and concerns
that the available literature does not support those treatments as efficacious.

EXERCISE FOR ULNAR NERVE ENTRAPMENT AT THE WRIST
No Recommendation
Exercise is not generally indicated acutely. Many patients with chronic findings, functional
deficits and post-operative patients require some appointments to at minimum help
institute a home exercise program. For patients with residual deficits, particularly postoperatively, see the recommendations for carpal tunnel syndrome.
Strength of evidence No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Frequency/Dose/Duration
In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operative, appointments should be scheduled
generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there has been functional improvements yet there
are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is often
helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week appointments)
may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe, and there is
ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g., increased
grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities, increased
duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are appropriate when
there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent objective functional
gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the therapy.

SURGICAL DECOMPRESSION FOR SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC ULNAR NERVE COMPRESSION
AT THE WRIST
Recommended
Surgical decompression is recommended for subacute or chronic ulnar nerve compression
at the wrist after failure of non-operative treatment or if space-occupying lesions are
present.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating the efficacy of surgical intervention for ulnar nerve
compression at the wrist. However, clinically many patients respond well to surgery. Surgery
is invasive, has adverse effects, and is costly. It is recommended for select patients who
failed trials of other non-operative treatments or if space occupying lesions are present. It
may also be preferential in those with diabetes mellitus.

WRIST SPRAINS
OVERVIEW
Wrist sprains (which are partially or totally disrupted ligaments) are a common result of
occupational slips, trips, and falls. Evaluation for occult fracture should be considered,
especially because fracture(s) may be present in a minority of cases.
Wrist sprains typically occur with acute traumatic events. The diagnosis is sometimes
applied as a diagnosis of exclusion among patients with pain in the setting of trauma with
negative fractures. However, the specific entity is properly defined as a partial ligamentous
disruption rather than undefined pain generators. Sprains may also occur as an
accompaniment to fracture.
The exam may include wrist capsule tenderness, or it may be normal. Deformity suggests
fracture. Scaphoid tubercle tenderness suggests scaphoid fracture. Patients invariably have

incurred an acute traumatic event, usually a slip, trip, or fall with forceful loading of the
wrist joint usually in a fully deviated position (e.g., full extension). They have pain in the
wrist joint, and generally have no swelling.
Patients generally require 1 to 3 appointments, depending on severity of the sprain and the
need for workplace limitations. Severe wrist sprains may require occupational or physical
therapy mostly for teaching mobilization exercises. Wrist sprains that do not resolve or
trends towards resolution by 6 weeks should have either further diagnostic evaluation or
referral for consideration of other diagnostic testing and treatment options.
This injury may or may not require work limitations depending on task demands. However,
moderate to severe wrist sprains likely necessitate splinting and limitations.
Causation is based on the specific major incident that produced the injury. Wrist sprains do
not occur without an acute, precipitating significant mechanism of injury.

DIAGNOSTIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Wrist sprains are diagnosed by history of an acute traumatic event with forceful loading of
the wrist, combined with a negative examination other than ligamentous tenderness and
negative x-rays.
X-RAYS FOR WRIST SPRAINS
Recommended
X-rays are recommended to determine whether a fracture is present, particularly for
patients with scaphoid pain or scaphoid tubercle tenderness.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating x-rays for wrist sprains. Mild wrist sprain may not
necessitate x-rays. There is no evidence other studies are helpful in the acute setting. (See
discussion of scaphoid fractures for other studies in the presence of ongoing, non-resolving
pain.) However, x-rays may assist in diagnosing and treating the condition (Guly, 2002) and
thus are recommended.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: X-Ray, Wrist
Sprain, Wrist Sprains, diagnostic, diagnosis, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,
negative predictive value, and predictive value of tests, efficacy, and efficiency. We found

CT SCANS FOR WRIST SPRAINS
Recommended
CT scans are recommended to determine whether a fracture is present, particularly for
patients with scaphoid pain or scaphoid tubercle tenderness with negative x-rays (Guly,
2002).
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are no quality studies incorporated into this analysis.

MR ARTHROGRAPHY FOR WRIST SPRAINS
Recommended
MR arthrography is recommended for patients without improvement in wrist sprains after
approximately 6 weeks of treatment.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating MR arthrography. However, MR arthrograms are
helpful to particularly identify ligamentous issues such as scapholunate, lunotriquetral, and
TFCC tears that may be diagnosed as simple sprains. Thus, MR arthrography is
recommended after approximately 6 weeks of clinical management.

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
Over-the-counter medications are generally helpful for pain associated with wrist sprain.
Prescription medications may be needed for moderate to severe cases.
RELATIVE REST FOR ACUTE WRIST SPRAINS
Recommended
Relative rest is recommended for treatment of acute wrist sprains.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are no quality studies evaluating relative rest, splints, or ice for wrist sprains.
However, these treatments may help with symptomatic relief. (Physicians should be aware
that early mobilization of ankle sprains results in improved clinical outcomes, and those
results may be applicable to the wrist.) These interventions are not invasive, have no
adverse effects, and are low cost, thus they are recommended.
Evidence

NSAIDS FOR ACUTE OR SUBACUTE WRIST SPRAIN
Recommended
NSAIDs are recommended to control pain associated with acute or subacute wrist sprain.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Evidence (C)

Rationale
There are no quality studies directly evaluating the use of NSAIDs and acetaminophen for
pain associated with wrist sprain; however, there are moderate-quality studies of lower
extremity sprains (Muckle, 1974, Muckle, 1977) and these injuries are believed to be
analogous (see Ankle and Foot Disorders Guideline). These medications may relieve pain
and increase function. They are not invasive, have few adverse effects in employed

POSTOPERATIVE REHABILITATION
Post-operative rehabilitation and rehabilitation for patients with distal upper extremity
musculoskeletal disorders has long been prescribed. Post-operative splinting was previously
widely used as evidenced in the older quality literature (434,438,459,828,829). But, plaster casts
have been replaced by splints which were later replaced by soft bandages and dressings

which has also coincided with, or been facilitated by, less
invasive and smaller incisions.
SOFT BANDAGES DURING POST-OPERATIVE REHABILITATION
Recommended
Soft bandages are recommended during post-operative rehabilitation.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
As surgery has become less invasive, the degree or whether to splint, has become
questionable as splints encourage lack of mobility which likely impairs or delays recovery
with potentially increasing risk of complex regional pain syndrome, debility and delayed
recovery. Three low-quality studies all suggest that splints are not effective (Bhatia et al.,
2000, Bury et al., 1995, Martins et al., 2006); however, there is no quality data and some
splints appear indicated for select patients. Thus, there are limited indications for splints in
patients with select diagnoses generally involving more extensive surgical procedures or
other needs to utilized splints for protective purposes.

NSAIDS DURING POST-OPERATIVE REHABILITATION
Recommended
NSAIDs are moderately recommended to control pain during post-operative rehabilitation.
Strength of evidence Moderately Recommended, Evidence (B)
Level of confidence High
Indications
All hand, wrist, forearm post-operative patients may be candidates other than those with
contraindications for use.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
Scheduled dosage rather than as needed is generally preferable initially.
Indications for discontinuation
Resolution of pain, lack of efficacy, development of adverse effects, particularly
gastrointestinal.
Rationale
Acetaminophen has been shown to be less efficacious than naproxen, but is recommended
due to its lower adverse effects (Husby et al., 2001).

ARNICA DURING POST-OPERATIVE REHABILITATION
Not Recommended
Arnica is not recommended during post-operative rehabilitation.
Strength of evidence Not Recommended, Evidence (C)
Level of confidence Low
Rationale
Arnica has been utilized for post-operative recovery in CTS patients (Stevinson et al., 2003,
Jeffrey et al., 2002), with the two quality studies conflicting. However, the higher quality
study suggests a lack of efficacy. Thus, there is overall weak evidence that arnica is
ineffective and it is not recommended.
Evidence
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane
Library, and Google Scholar without date limits using the following terms: Arnica, Montana,
Postoperative Period, post-operative, rehabilitation, upper, extremity; controlled clinical
trial, controlled trials, randomized controlled trial, randomized controlled trials, random

Cryotherapy is recommended for post-operative rehabilitation for carpal tunnel release
patients.

Cryotherapy has been shown to be effective for post-carpal tunnel release patients and is
therefore recommended during post-operative rehabilitation. The evidence is in favor of a
cooling blanket versus ice therapy; therefore, a cooling blanket is recommended during
post-operative rehabilitation (Hochberg, 2001).

ACTIVITY DURING POST-OPERATIVE REHABILITATION FOR PATIENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL
DEFICITS
Recommended
It is recommended that post-operative patients or those with functional deficits stay as
active as possible and use the hand as much as possible post-operatively or post-injury.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Indications
Failure to progress, or moderate to severe functional deficits.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operative, appointments should be scheduled
generally weekly for up to 5-6 visits. If there have been functional improvements yet there
are ongoing objective functional deficits, an additional set of 5-6 appointments is often
helpful (up to 12 visits total). More than 12 visits (or more than once a week appointments)
may be rarely needed when the initial functional deficits were more severe, and there is
ongoing functional gain that is measured towards the end of a set of visits (e.g., increased
grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities, increased
duration of exercises or work). Additional sets of 5-6 appointments are appropriate when
there is evidence of ongoing functional gain, but are not advised absent objective functional
gain. Home exercises should be performed in conjunction with the therapy.
Indications for discontinuation
Achievement of goals, failure to progress, adverse effects, non-compliance.
Rationale
Most of the quality studies that have described post-operative rehabilitation components
have not prescribed formal physical or occupational therapy for rehabilitation (Dumontier et
al., 1995, Trumble et al., 2002, Ferdinand et al., 2002, Blair et al., 1992). Instead, most
instructed patients to “keep fingers moving” or perform finger exercises (Golimbu et al.,
1989, Park et al., 2010), perform mobility exercises (Wong et al., 2003), use the hand daily
as tolerated (Atroshi et al., 2006), use “as comfort allowed,” (Saw et al., 2003) or “use as
much as possible” or “as soon as possible” (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2006, Siegmeth et al.,
2006, Menovsky et al., 2004). Unfortunately, there is little quality evidence comparing
approaches and there is likely a significant difference between using the hand “as tolerated”
and “as much as possible. ” There also are no quality studies comparing specific exercises
for rehabilitation of patients with deficits compared with no treatment or home exercise
programs. Quality studies are needed to address these issues, particularly as they may
impact the sizable lost-time problems. In the absence of quality evidence, but inferring from
numerous other MSD diagnoses that suggest activity is helpful, it is recommended that

well as for those with functional deficits, and that there should be a low threshold for
institution of formal physical or occupational therapy for rehabilitation.

for inclusion, 17 randomized trials and 2 systematic studies met the inclusion criteria.
EXERCISE DURING POST-OPERATIVE REHABILITATION FOR PATIENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL
DEFICITS
Recommended
It is recommended that post-operative patients or those with functional deficits perform
graded, increased exercises post-operatively or post-injury. A home exercise program may
accomplish this for many patients.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence High
Indications
Failure to progress, or moderate to severe functional deficits.
Frequency/Dose/Duration
In the event it is needed for recovery or post-operative, appointments should be scheduled

FORMAL PHYSICAL OR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY DURING POST-OPERATIVE
REHABILITATION FOR PATIENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL DEFICITS
Recommended
A low threshold for institution of formal physical or occupational therapy for rehabilitation is
recommended for postoperative patients.
Postoperative patients should be observed particularly for failure to progress as expected,
as well as for complex regional pain syndrome (see Chronic Pain guideline) or other

low threshold to refer to therapy for formal treatment if deficits are considerable or there is
a failure to progress as expected with a home exercise program.

RETURN-TO-WORK PROGRAMS
Return-to-work programs have not been well studied among patients with hand, wrist, or
forearm injuries (see Chronic Pain Guideline for discussion of principles). Several studies
suggest that job physical demands, lack of job accommodation, and psychosocial conditions
are the most important factors in predicting work disability (832,833,834).
Key factors to consider in disability duration are age and job activities. By communicating
with patients and employers, physicians can make it clear that:
●
Forceful repetitive grasping may increase forearm, hand, and wrist symptoms.
●
Modified work and workplace activity guides may allow for recovery or time to
(re)build activity tolerance through exercise.
Significant reductions in unnecessary lost work time can occur when the patient, physician,
and employer work together to develop and apply modified work activities (835,836,837,838,839).
RETURN-TO-WORK PROGRAMS FOR SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC HAND, WRIST, OR FOREARM
MSDS
Recommended
Return-to-work programs are recommended for treatment of subacute or chronic hand,
wrist, or forearm MSDs, particularly patients with significant lost time.
Strength of evidence Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I)
Level of confidence Moderate
Rationale
There are no quality studies that review the types of return-to-work programs typically
found in the United States. There is one quality study from Spain (Feuerstein et al., 1993);
however, most patients had spine disorders and the program otherwise may have limited
applicability due to longstanding, early active management of these issues in the United
States. These programs are thought to reduce morbidity and improve function. They are not

programs are recommended for management of select patients with hand, wrist, and

emphases on functional recovery.
Evidence
There is 1 moderate-quality RCT incorporated into this analysis. See Chronic Pain Guideline
for additional studies.
