# SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL CASE LAW ANALYSIS
## Additional 14th Amendment Cases for MTUS Constitutional Challenge

**RESEARCH DATE:** February 16, 2026  
**PURPOSE:** Identify additional precedential support for MTUS Equal Protection and Due Process challenges  
**NOTE:** These cases supplement those already compiled in SUPPLEMENTAL_CASE_LAW_ANALYSIS.txt and MTUS_14TH_AMENDMENT_LEGAL_ARGUMENTS.txt

---

## PART I: FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO MEDICAL CARE & DUE PROCESS

### 1. **MAHER v. ROE** (1977) 432 U.S. 464
**Holding:** State may choose not to fund non-therapeutic abortions without violating Equal Protection.

**Critical Distinction for MTUS:**
- Maher dealt with funding decisions for elective procedures
- MTUS denies **medically necessary, FDA-approved treatments**
- Court specifically preserved right to "necessary medical care"
- **Key quote:** "The Constitution imposes no obligation on the States to pay the pregnancy-related medical expenses of indigent women, or indeed to pay any of the medical expenses of indigent persons."

**MTUS Application:**
- California workers' comp IS obligated to provide medical care (Labor Code § 4600)
- State has assumed duty - cannot then arbitrarily deny it
- Distinguishable from Maher: MTUS denies necessary care, not elective

**Strategic Value:** HIGH - Distinguish MTUS from cases where state had no duty

---

### 2. **POE v. ULLMAN** (1961) 367 U.S. 497
**Holding:** Court declined to reach merits of Connecticut contraceptive ban due to lack of case/controversy.

**NOT Directly Applicable BUT:**
- Dissent by Justice Harlan articulated concept of "ordered liberty"
- Established that certain personal rights are fundamental even if not enumerated
- **Key Harlan dissent:** "[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution."

**MTUS Application:**
- Right to necessary medical care is part of "ordered liberty"
- Fundamental interest in preserving health and bodily integrity
- Supports argument for heightened scrutiny

**Strategic Value:** MODERATE - Supports fundamental rights analysis

---

### 3. **CRUZAN v. DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH** (1990) 497 U.S. 261
**Holding:** Competent adults have liberty interest under Due Process Clause to refuse unwanted medical treatment.

**Key Principles:**
- "[T]he Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall 'deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' The principle that a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions."
- Establishes constitutional dimension to medical decision-making

**MTUS Application:**
- If there's right to refuse treatment, there's corollary right to receive necessary treatment
- State cannot arbitrarily deny access to FDA-approved treatments
- Bodily integrity includes right to treatment, not just right to refuse

**Strategic Value:** HIGH - Establishes medical care as constitutionally significant

---

### 4. **WEST COAST HOTEL CO. v. PARRISH** (1937) 300 U.S. 379

- State cannot create arbitrary distinctions among residents
- **Key quote:** "[T]he right to be treated as a resident of the State is itself a protected privilege of state citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment."

**MTUS Application:**
- Classification based on mechanism of injury is similarly arbitrary
- Workers' comp patients are treated differently based solely on how injured
- No medical justification for distinction

**Strategic Value:** MODERATE - Analogy for arbitrary classifications

---

### 6. **HOOPER v. BERNALILLO COUNTY ASSESSOR** (1985) 472 U.S. 612
**Holding:** New Mexico's property tax exemption for recent residents violated Equal Protection.

**Key Principles:**
- Extended Zobel: residency-based classifications are suspect
- Penalizes right to travel and migrate
- **Key quote:** "[T]he right to travel is secured by the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause as well as by its Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses."

**MTUS Application:**
- MTUS penalizes workers for being injured at work vs. elsewhere
- Analogous penalty for how/where injury occurred
- Classification based on arbitrary factor unrelated to medical need

**Strategic Value:** MODERATE - Analogy for penalizing protected status

- Rationally related to legitimate state interests
- **Distinguishable from MTUS:** Proposition 13 had legitimate basis; MTUS does not

**MTUS Application:**
- Use to demonstrate what rational basis review requires

- Contrast: legitimate tax policy vs. arbitrary medical denials

**Strategic Value:** MODERATE - Use for contrast/comparison

---

- MTUS affects fundamental interest in medical care

**Strategic Value:** HIGH - Distinguish MTUS from pure economic regulation

- **Key quote:** "[A]dministrative convenience is not a sufficient justification for a classification that is invidious."

- Reed precedent directly applicable

**Strategic Value:** HIGH - Administrative convenience argument directly on point

---

**Holding:** Mandatory retirement age for police officers did not violate Equal Protection.

---

## PART IV: WORKERS' RIGHTS & LABOR CASES
