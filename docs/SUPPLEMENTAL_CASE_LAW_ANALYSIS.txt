# Supplemental 14th Amendment Case Law Analysis
## For MTUS Constitutional Challenge

**RESEARCH NOTE:** This document presents potentially relevant case law for educational and analytical purposes. Inclusion of a case does not guarantee it applies to the MTUS situation. This is legal research, not legal advice.

---

## I. SUSPECT CLASSIFICATION CASES

### 1. Brown v. Board of Education (1954) 347 U.S. 483
**Holding:** Racial segregation in public schools violates Equal Protection.

**Potential Application to MTUS:**
- While race-based, Brown established that "separate but equal" is inherently unequal
- MTUS creates separate treatment standards for workers' comp patients vs. all other patients
- Could analogize: Separate medical standards are inherently unequal when they produce inferior outcomes
- **Limitation:** Workers' comp status is not a suspect class like race

**Better Fit:** Demonstrates constitutional intolerance for dual-tier systems

---

### 2. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center (1985) 473 U.S. 432
**Already cited in your brief** - Good precedent for "irrational classification"

---

### 3. Romer v. Evans (1996) 517 U.S. 620
**Holding:** Colorado amendment denying LGBT people protection from discrimination violated Equal Protection (rational basis review).

**Potential Application:**
- Law singled out one group for disfavored treatment
- Court found no rational basis for animus-based classification
- MTUS singles out workers' comp patients for disfavored medical treatment
- **Key quote:** "A law declaring that in general it shall be more difficult for one group of citizens than for all others to seek aid from the government is itself a denial of equal protection."

**Strong analog to MTUS:** Workers' comp patients face more difficult path to medical care

---

## II. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS / MEDICAL CARE CASES

### 4. Estelle v. Gamble (1976) 429 U.S. 97
**Already cited** - Prisoner medical care, deliberate indifference standard

---

### 5. Youngberg v. Romeo (1982) 457 U.S. 307
**Holding:** Institutionalized mentally disabled persons have liberty interest in safety and freedom from bodily restraint, including adequate food, shelter, clothing, and medical care.

**Potential Application:**
- Establishes constitutional right to medical care for vulnerable, state-dependent populations
- Injured workers are state-dependent (must use workers' comp system)
- State cannot be deliberately indifferent to serious medical needs
- **Strong precedent** for fundamental right to medical care when state has assumed duty

---

### 6. DeShaney v. Winnebago County (1989) 489 U.S. 189
**Holding:** State generally has no duty to protect individuals from private harm unless state has created special relationship.

**Counter-point to MTUS argument:**
- State has no general duty to provide medical care
- **BUT:** Distinguishable - California HAS created special relationship via workers' comp statute
- State assumed duty to provide medical care through Labor Code § 4600
- Creates the "special relationship" DeShaney requires

**Use strategically:** Acknowledge then distinguish

---

## III. RATIONAL BASIS FAILURES

### 7. U.S. Department of Agriculture v. Moreno (1973) 413 U.S. 528
**Holding:** Law denying food stamps to households containing unrelated persons had no rational basis; appeared motivated by bare congressional desire to harm "hippies."

**Potential Application:**
- Court struck down classification that seemed designed to harm disfavored group
- MTUS classification may appear designed to reduce costs at expense of injured workers
- **Key quote:** "[T]he challenged classification... cannot be deemed rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest."

**Strong precedent** for irrational classification targeting vulnerable group

---

### 8. City of Los Angeles v. Manheimer (1976) - wait, check this
Actually: **Village of Willowbrook v. Olech** (2000) 528 U.S. 562
**Holding:** Equal Protection clause protects against irrational classifications even when not suspect class or fundamental right.

**Potential Application:**
- "Class of one" theory - treating similarly situated person differently without rational basis violates Equal Protection
- Each injured worker denied FDA-approved treatment is a "class of one" treated differently from non-workers' comp patients
- **Very strong precedent** for MTUS

---

### 9. Williams v. Pryor (2000) - actually **Williams v. Alabama** (2019)? Let me use:
**Fitzgerald v. Racing Association of Central Iowa** (2003) - actually better:

### 9. Armour v. City of Indianapolis (2012) 566 U.S. 673
**Holding:** Administrative convenience can be rational basis for classification.

**Counter-point to MTUS:**
- State may argue MTUS is administrative convenience for cost control
- **Response:** Administrative convenience cannot justify unconstitutional classification
- Moreno and Romer trump administrative convenience

---

## IV. IRREBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION CASES

### 10. Vlandis v. Kline (1973) 412 U.S. 441
**Holding:** States may not impose irrebuttable presumptions that deny individuals opportunity to prove actual facts.

**Already in your brief** - Strong precedent

---

### 11. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur (1974) 414 U.S. 632
**Holding:** Mandatory pregnancy leave policies based on irrebuttable presumptions of incapacity violate Due Process.

**Potential Application:**
- MTUS creates irrebuttable presumption: "Insufficient evidence" = automatic denial
- No opportunity to prove FDA-approved treatment would help individual patient
- **Strong analog**

---

### 12. Stanley v. Illinois (1972) 405 U.S. 645
**Holding:** Presumption that unwed fathers are unfit parents violates Due Process.

**Potential Application:**
- MTUS presumption: FDA-approved treatments are "not recommended" for workers
- Presumption operates against interest of injured workers
- **Good supporting precedent**

---

## V. DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT / DISPARATE IMPACT

### 13. Washington v. Davis (1976) 426 U.S. 229
**Holding:** Disparate impact alone does not violate Equal Protection; need proof of discriminatory purpose for strict scrutiny.

**Counter-point to MTUS:**
- Washington v. Davis requires proof of discriminatory intent for strict scrutiny
- MTUS argument uses rational basis, not strict scrutiny
- **Your strategy:** Don't need discriminatory intent for rational basis challenge
- Just need to show classification lacks rational relationship to legitimate purpose

**Use strategically:** Distinguish - you're arguing irrational classification, not racial discrimination

---

### 14. Personnel Administrator v. Feeney (1979) 442 U.S. 256
**Holding:** Discriminatory purpose means more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.

**Potential Counter-argument:**
- State may argue MTUS discriminatory effects are incidental, not purposeful
- **Response:** Even if not purposefully discriminatory, classification is still irrational under rational basis

---

## VI. SPECIAL CASE: MEDICAL MARIJUANA / STATE EXPERIMENTATION

### 15. Gonzales v. Raich (2005) 545 U.S. 1
**Holding:** Federal Commerce Clause power overrides state medical marijuana laws.

**Not directly relevant** but shows federal courts do consider medical necessity arguments

---

## VII. STRONGEST CASES FOR MTUS ARGUMENT

### Tier 1 (Most Directly Applicable):
1. **Romer v. Evans** - Singling out group for disfavored treatment
2. **Moreno** - Classification appears designed to harm vulnerable group  
3. **Youngberg v. Romeo** - Right to medical care for state-dependent populations
4. **Olech** - "Class of one" irrational classification theory
5. **Cleburne** - Irrational classification of vulnerable group

### Tier 2 (Strong Supporting):
6. **LaFleur** - Irrebuttable presumptions violate Due Process
7. **Vlandis** - Same
8. **Stanley** - Presumptions operating against individual interests
9. **Estelle** - Deliberate indifference to medical needs

### Tier 3 (Contextual/Supporting):
10. **Brown** - Philosophical intolerance for separate-but-unequal
11. **Romer language** - More difficult for one group to seek aid

---

## VIII. CASES TO DISTINGUISH (State Will Likely Cite)

### 1. Washington v. Davis (1976)
**State argument:** No discriminatory intent, therefore no Equal Protection violation.
**Your response:** 
- Davis applies strict scrutiny requiring intent
- MTUS challenge uses rational basis review
- Under rational basis, don't need intent - just need to show classification is irrational
- See Moreno, Romer (irrational classifications struck down without finding discriminatory intent)

---

### 2. DeShaney v. Winnebago County (1989)
**State argument:** No general duty to provide medical care.
**Your response:**
- DeShaney requires "special relationship" for state duty
- California workers' comp statute creates special relationship
- State assumed duty to provide medical care via Labor Code § 4600
- See Youngberg (state assumed duty creates constitutional obligation)

---

### 3. Harris v. McRae (1980) 448 U.S. 297
**Holding:** Hyde Amendment (no federal funding for abortion) does not violate Due Process or Equal Protection.

**State argument:** State can choose what medical treatments to fund.
**Your response:**
- McRae involved abortion (controversial, not medically consensus)
- MTUS involves FDA-approved treatments for work injuries (medically accepted)
- State cannot deny medically necessary care to one class while providing to others
- See Moreno (cannot single out group for disfavored treatment)

---

## IX. SYNTHESIS: WINNING ARGUMENT STRUCTURE

### Primary Theory: Irrational Classification (Rational Basis)
**Using:** Romer, Moreno, Cleburne, Olech

**Argument:**
1. MTUS creates classification between workers' comp patients and all other patients
2. Classification has no rational relationship to legitimate state interest
3. Reducing costs by denying FDA-approved treatments is not legitimate (Moreno)
4. Classification appears designed to disadvantage injured workers (Romer)
5. Even if cost-control is legitimate, means chosen are irrational (Cleburne)

---

### Secondary Theory: Irrebuttable Presumption
**Using:** Vlandis, LaFleur, Stanley

**Argument:**
1. MTUS "Insufficient Evidence" creates irrebuttable presumption
2. Presumption: FDA-approved treatments automatically denied
3. No opportunity for individualized showing of medical necessity
4. Violates Due Process and Equal Protection

---

### Tertiary Theory: Fundamental Right / State-Created Duty
**Using:** Youngberg, Estelle

**Argument:**
1. State assumed duty to provide medical care (Labor Code § 4600)
2. Creates special relationship (distinguishing DeShaney)
3. State cannot be deliberately indifferent to serious medical needs
4. Denial of FDA-approved treatments is deliberate indifference

---

## X. BROWN V. BOARD SPECIFIC ANALYSIS

**Direct Application:** Weak (race vs. workers' comp status)

**Philosophical Application:** Strong

**Use Brown for:**
- Symbolic power of "separate but equal" being inherently unequal
- MTUS creates separate medical standard for workers' comp
- Philosophical argument: Dual-tier medical care is inherently unequal
- **Limitation:** Must acknowledge race is suspect class; workers' comp status is not
- **Use in:** Introduction/conclusion for emotional/philosophical impact
- **Don't rely on:** As binding precedent (distinguishable on facts)

**Better doctrinal fit:** Romer, Moreno, Olech

---

## XI. RECOMMENDED CASES TO ADD TO BRIEF

### Must Add:
1. **Romer v. Evans** (1996) - Singling out group for disfavored treatment
2. **Village of Willowbrook v. Olech** (2000) - "Class of one" theory
3. **Youngberg v. Romeo** (1982) - State duty to provide medical care

### Should Add:
4. **Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur** (1974) - Irrebuttable presumptions
5. **U.S. Dept. of Agriculture v. Moreno** (1973) - Classification designed to harm
6. **Stanley v. Illinois** (1972) - Presumptions against individual interests

### Optional (Philosophical):
7. **Brown v. Board** (1954) - Separate is inherently unequal (acknowledge limitations)

---

## XII. CASES TO PREEMPTIVELY DISTINGUISH

Prepare responses to:
1. **Washington v. Davis** - Intent not required for rational basis
2. **DeShaney** - Special relationship exists via workers' comp statute
3. **Harris v. McRae** - Abortion distinguishable; FDA-approved treatments different

---

## CONCLUSION

The strongest precedents for MTUS challenge are:
1. **Romer** (singling out group)
2. **Moreno** (irrational classification)
3. **Olech** (class of one)
4. **Youngberg** (state duty to provide care)
5. **Vlandis/LaFleur** (irrebuttable presumptions)

Brown v. Board has **symbolic value** but weak **doctrinal fit** due to race-based suspect classification.

Focus on rational basis precedents (Romer, Moreno, Olech) combined with irrebuttable presumption cases (Vlandis, LaFleur).
