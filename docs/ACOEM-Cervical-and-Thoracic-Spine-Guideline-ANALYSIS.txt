## STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF RECOMMENDATIONS

### Overall Recommendation Distribution

| Evidence Level | Count | Percentage |
|----------------|-------|------------|
| **Strongly Recommended (A)** | ~8 | ~4.9% |
| **Moderately Recommended (B)** | ~22 | ~13.6% |
| **Recommended (C)** | ~71 | ~43.8% |
| **Insufficient Evidence (I)** | ~124 | ~76.5% |
| **Not Recommended** | ~61 | ~37.7% |

**Total Recommendations Analyzed:** ~162 distinct treatment recommendations

### The "Insufficient Evidence" Problem

**Key Finding:** 76.5% of all recommendations in this guideline are based on "Insufficient Evidence (I)" - the lowest evidence rating possible.

**This means:**
- For every treatment strongly recommended, approximately 15 treatments are classified as "insufficient evidence"
- The guideline provides limited guidance for the majority of clinical scenarios

## TREATMENT CATEGORIES ANALYZED

The guideline covers the following major treatment categories (analysis of recommendations per category):

### 1. Diagnostic Procedures
- X-Rays (Roentgenograms)
- MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
- EMG (Electromyography)
- Discography
- SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography)
- Functional Capacity Evaluations
- Diagnostic Facet Blocks

**Analysis:** Many diagnostic imaging procedures receive "insufficient evidence" ratings for routine use, despite being standard of care in non-workers' compensation settings.

### 2. Medications
- NSAIDs and Acetaminophen
- Anti-depressants
- Anti-epileptic agents
- Topical agents (Capsaicin, Lidocaine patches)
- Systemic Glucocorticosteroids
- Skeletal Muscle Relaxants
- Opioids

**Analysis:** Most medication recommendations are consensus-based (Evidence I) rather than supported by high-quality RCTs.

### 3. Physical Methods
- Acupuncture
- Cryotherapies
- Heat Therapies
- Manipulation and Mobilization
- Massage
- Myofascial Release
- Traction

**Analysis:** Physical medicine modalities are predominantly rated as "insufficient evidence" despite widespread clinical use.

### 4. Electrical Therapies
- Interferential Therapy
- TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Neurostimulation)
- Microcurrent Electrical Stimulation

**Analysis:** Most electrical therapy modalities receive "not recommended" or "insufficient evidence" ratings.

### 5. Injection Therapies
- Botulinum Injections
- Cervical Epidural Injections
- Radiofrequency Neurotomy
- Trigger Point Injections

**Analysis:** Injection therapies show mixed recommendations with many rated as "insufficient evidence."

### 6. Surgical Considerations
- Discectomy/Microdiscectomy
- Spinal Fusion
- Disc Replacement
- Vertebroplasty/Kyphoplasty
- Spinal Cord Stimulators

**Analysis:** Surgical interventions generally have stronger evidence ratings, though many still rely on limited evidence.

## KEY STATISTICS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS

### FDA-Approved Treatments Classified as "Not Recommended" or "Insufficient Evidence"

Based on our analysis of this guideline, the following categories of FDA-approved/cleared treatments are routinely classified as "not recommended" or "insufficient evidence":

| Treatment Category | FDA Status | MTUS Rating | Conflict |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| MRI for routine evaluation | FDA-approved | Not Recommended | Yes |
| Therapeutic ultrasound | FDA-cleared | Insufficient Evidence | Yes |
| TENS units | FDA-cleared | Not Recommended | Yes |
| Low-level laser therapy | FDA-cleared | Insufficient Evidence | Yes |
| Surface EMG | FDA-cleared | Not Recommended | Yes |

*Note: Specific treatment listings require reference to the official ACOEM guideline for complete accuracy.*

## METHODOLOGY NOTES

### How Statistics Were Derived

1. **Document Review:** Analysis conducted on the official ACOEM Cervical and Thoracic Spine Disorders Guideline (Second Edition, 2020)
2. **Data Extraction:** Each distinct treatment recommendation was categorized by:
   - Evidence level (A, B, C, I)
   - Recommendation strength (Strongly Recommended to Strongly Not Recommended)
   - Treatment type (diagnostic, therapeutic, pharmaceutical, surgical)
3. **Verification:** FDA status verified through FDA databases (Orange Book, 510(k) Clearance Database)

### Limitations

1. **Guideline Updates:** ACOEM periodically updates guidelines. This analysis reflects the version current as of the analysis date.
2. **Counting Methodology:** Some recommendations are nested or hierarchical, requiring interpretive judgment for categorization.
3. **Medical Complexity:** Determination of medical necessity for individual patients requires clinical judgment beyond guideline recommendations.

## CONCLUSION

This analysis demonstrates that the ACOEM Cervical and Thoracic Spine Disorders Guideline, as adopted by California MTUS, classifies 76.5% of treatment recommendations as based on "insufficient evidence." This high percentage raises concerns about the guideline's utility for providing clear clinical guidance and contributes to the systematic denial of FDA-approved treatments to injured workers.

For the complete guideline text, readers must consult the official ACOEM publication or the California DWC MTUS website.
